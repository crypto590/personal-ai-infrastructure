# Alex Hormozi Pitch Skill

## When to Activate This Skill
- Create compelling offer or pitch
- Design irresistible value proposition
- Structure pricing and guarantees
- Build "too good not to take" offer
- Apply Hormozi frameworks
- Optimize existing offer
- Create Grand Slam Offer

## What This Skill Does

Guides you through Alex Hormozi's systematic approach to creating offers so compelling that prospects feel stupid saying no, using proven frameworks from "$100M Offers".

## How to Execute

**Execute the `/create-hormozi-pitch` slash command**, which provides:

1. Interactive guided process through Hormozi's frameworks
2. Value Equation optimization (Dream Outcome, Perceived Likelihood, Time Delay, Effort & Sacrifice)
3. Guarantee framework selection and structuring
4. Value stack and bonus construction
5. Scarcity and urgency implementation
6. Objection elimination strategies
7. Complete pitch output ready to use

## Core Frameworks Applied

### The Value Equation
```
Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)
```

### Four Guarantee Types
- Unconditional (money-back)
- Conditional (performance-based)
- Outcome-based (results-tied)
- Anti-guarantee (all sales final)

### MAGIC Naming Formula
- **M**ake it about them
- **A**nnounce the avatar
- **G**ive them a goal
- **I**ndicate a time interval
- **C**omplete with container word

## Use Cases

- Product launches
- Service offerings
- Consulting proposals
- Course creation
- High-ticket sales
- Lead magnets
- Upsells and downsells

## Iterative Refinement Loop

After generating the initial pitch, evaluate and iterate:

1. **Generate** initial pitch using frameworks above
2. **Evaluate** against quality criteria:
   - Value Equation score: Does each component maximize value?
   - Guarantee strength: Is it bold enough to reduce perceived risk to zero?
   - Specificity: Are outcomes concrete with numbers, not vague promises?
   - Objection coverage: Does the offer preemptively handle top 3 objections?
   - Scarcity/urgency: Is there a real reason to act now?
3. **Iterate** on weakest scoring area - improve one dimension per pass
4. **Stop when** all criteria pass OR 3 refinement cycles complete (diminishing returns)

Present the user with the evaluation scores after each pass so they can guide further refinement.
