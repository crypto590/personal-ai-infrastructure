# Technical Skills

Programming, engineering, and technology-focused capabilities.

## What Goes Here

Technical skills for software development, DevOps, system design, and engineering:

- Programming language patterns and best practices
- Framework-specific implementations
- API design patterns
- Database design and optimization
- Testing strategies
- Deployment workflows
- Performance optimization
- Security implementations
- Code review approaches
- Debugging methodologies

## Examples

- `api-design.md` - REST/GraphQL API design patterns
- `typescript-patterns.md` - TypeScript best practices and patterns
- `react-patterns.md` - React component patterns
- `nextjs-development.md` - Next.js development approaches
- `database-design.md` - Database schema and query design
- `testing-strategy.md` - Unit, integration, and E2E testing
- `error-handling.md` - Error handling and logging patterns
- `authentication.md` - Auth implementation patterns
- `performance-optimization.md` - Performance tuning approaches
- `code-review.md` - Code review methodology

## When to Use Technical Skills

Load when implementing features, solving technical problems, or making engineering decisions.

**Example:** TypeScript patterns + API design + Error handling = Building a type-safe API with robust error handling
