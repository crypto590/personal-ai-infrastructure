# ARCHIVED: swift-architecture

**Archived on:** 2025-11-05

**Replaced by:** `swift-mvc` skill

---

## Why Archived

This skill used **ViewModel** terminology and a progressive architecture approach (Level 1, 2, 3).

It has been replaced by the `swift-mvc` skill which:
- Uses modern **Controller** terminology (MVC pattern)
- Enforces strict production-ready patterns from the start
- Aligns with `/Users/coreyyoung/Claude/context/knowledge/languages/swift-conventions.md`
- Includes modern patterns like Liquid Glass (iOS 26+)

---

## What to Use Instead

**For modern Swift/SwiftUI development:**
Use `/Users/coreyyoung/Claude/skills/technical/swift-mvc/`

**This includes:**
- Controllers (@Observable patterns)
- Services (Actor/struct patterns)
- Models (Immutable structs)
- Views (SwiftUI delegation)
- Error Handling
- Navigation
- Advanced Patterns
- Testing
- Liquid Glass (iOS 26+)

## Preserved Content

The SOLID principles content from this skill may be extracted to a separate `swift-solid-principles` skill in the future if needed. For now, SOLID principles are embedded throughout the swift-mvc skill documentation.

## If You Need This Skill

If you have a specific need for the progressive/ViewModel-based approach in this archived skill, you can:
1. Restore it by removing the `.archived` suffix
2. Use it alongside `swift-mvc` for different projects
3. Extract specific content you need

However, for most modern Swift/SwiftUI projects, `swift-mvc` is the recommended approach.
