Map the ENTIRE current folder structure (use ls, tree commands, glob patterns)\n2. Identify ALL directories named \"apps\" or similar (api-server, src, web, etc.)\n3. Compare the current structure against the proposed structure in the clean architecture refactor plan\n4. Identify discrepancies, duplicates, and misalignments\n5. Check for:\n   - Duplicate code/schemas in multiple locations\n   - Folders that should have been moved/renamed per the plan\n   - Missing expected directories\n   - Incorrect nesting or organization\n6. Assess whether the monorepo structure (apps/ + packages/) has been properly implemented\n7. Check if the frontend has been properly moved from src/ to apps/web/\n8. Check if the backend has been properly moved from api-server/ to apps/api/\n\nReturn a detailed analysis including:\n- Current vs. expected structure comparison\n- List of all structural issues found\n- Assessment of which refactor phases were completed vs. incomplete\n- Specific misalignments with the plan\n- Recommendations for fixing the structure\n\nBe thorough - examine the entire project root and all subdirectories."},"uuid":"b8ced13d-b6f0-445d-97ce-f9ba62f7c30e","timestamp":"2025-11-01T21:49:18.820Z"}
