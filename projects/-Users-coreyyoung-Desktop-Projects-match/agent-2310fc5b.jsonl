Use conventional commit format focusing on technical changes.\n\n2. **Core Philosophy**: Follow the simplified architecture - prioritize simplicity, maintainability, and operational efficiency. No over-engineering.\n\n3. **Development Principles**: Read the Development Principles doc before changes. Keep functions under 50 lines, files under 300 lines. Be explicit over clever.\n\n4. **Documentation Structure**: Use the organized docs - platform-docs for external sharing, internal for dev team, reports for compliance/testing, archive for historical reference.\n\n5. **Tech Stack**: Next.js 15 frontend, Fastify backend, Neon PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, JWT auth. Keep the simplified middleware stack (3 layers: auth + rate limiting + validation).\n\n6. **Tools Discussion**: If new tools are needed (like Redis), we should discuss pros/cons and verify with you first.\n\nI'm currently on the `feature/ofac-production-ready` branch with several modified files related to OFAC functionality.\n\nI'm prepared to:\n- Search files using glob patterns and regex\n- Read and analyze code content\n- Navigate the codebase thoroughly\n- Provide absolute file paths in responses\n- Avoid system modifications\n\nWhat would you like me to help you with?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3739,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":333,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CUfd7Rohgd2ZQXBRZkcK9","type":"assistant","uuid":"93617832-b3a4-43ec-832e-1c6b2c33cb85","timestamp":"2025-10-31T16:52:33.477Z"}
