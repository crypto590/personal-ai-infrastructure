App Distribution**\n- Only works on **your device** (or devices with registered UDIDs)\n- Can't share with others unless they're on your Apple Developer provisioning profile\n- Max 100 test devices per year\n\n**2. Certificate/Provisioning**\n- Need proper **provisioning profile** for certain features\n- **Development certificate** vs production certificate (different signing)\n- Some services need production certs (e.g., Apple Pay, certain push notification features)\n\n**3. Performance**\n- Debug builds are **slightly slower** than release builds\n- Not a problem for testing, but not final optimization\n\n## For LiveKit Specifically\n- ✅ Works perfectly in development\n- ✅ WebRTC connections are identical to production\n- ✅ Token generation from your production server works fine\n- ⚠️ Make sure your **LiveKit server allows your development app's bundle ID** (if you have restrictions)\n\n## Testing Flow\n```\nXcode → Build to iPhone\n    ↓\nApp launches on device\n    ↓\nConnects to production LiveKit server\n    ↓\nGenerates token via your Vercel API\n    ↓\nJoins live stream - WORKS EXACTLY LIKE PRODUCTION\n```\n\n## What You Need\n1. **Apple Developer account** ($99/year) for device testing\n2. **Proper bundle ID** configured\n3. **Code signing** set up in Xcode\n4. **Info.plist permissions** for camera/mic\n\n**Bottom line**: Your development build behaves identically to a production app when connecting to external services.
