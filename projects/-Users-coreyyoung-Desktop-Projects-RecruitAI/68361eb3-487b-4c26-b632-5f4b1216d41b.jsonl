This allows:\n\n1. **Persistent Program Data**: Recruit information belongs to the organization (program), not individual coaches\n2. **Role-Based Access**: \n   - **Admin role**: Head coach or athletic department staff who can manage membership\n   - **Member role**: Assistant coaches who can access recruit data\n3. **Seamless Transitions**: When a coach leaves, simply remove them from the organization - all recruit data stays with the program\n4. **Centralized Management**: Athletic directors or compliance officers can oversee multiple programs\n\n## Implementation Approach\n\n```typescript\n// Organization structure\n{\n  organizationId: \"org_xyz_football\",\n  name: \"University of XYZ Football Program\",\n  members: [\n    { userId: \"head_coach_id\", role: \"admin\" },\n    { userId: \"assistant_coach_1\", role: \"basic_member\" },\n    { userId: \"assistant_coach_2\", role: \"basic_member\" },\n    { userId: \"recruiting_coordinator\", role: \"admin\" }\n  ]\n}\n\n// In your database, link recruit data to organization\n{\n  recruitId: \"...\",\n  organizationId: \"org_xyz_football\", // Not individual coach\n  // ... other recruit data\n}\n```\n\n## Key Considerations\n\n- **Invitations**: Head coaches can invite/remove assistant coaches\n- **Data Ownership**: All recruits, notes, evaluations belong to the org\n- **Permissions**: Use Clerk's role system to control who can edit vs view\n- **Compliance**: Athletic staff can have read-only admin access for oversight\n\nThis is a standard SaaS model - similar to how companies (not employees) own customer data in CRMs."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":4,"cache_creation_input_tokens":19196,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":19196,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":444,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CTpXJZ9u1iak72tpTzmFf","type":"assistant","uuid":"f40c8353-46f0-451b-8bcf-bebf9c6e0ebf","timestamp":"2025-10-05T18:27:23.483Z"}

You need a **hybrid model** that balances institutional data ownership with individual coach relationships. Here's the solution:\n\n## Dual-Ownership Architecture\n\n### 1. **Organization-Owned Data** (Program Level)\n```typescript\n// Official program evaluations - stays with school\n{\n  recruitId: \"...\",\n  organizationId: \"org_xyz_football\",\n  officialEvaluation: {\n    rating: 4.5,\n    position: \"QB\",\n    offers: [...],\n    visits: [...]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### 2. **Personal Coach Data** (Individual Level)\n```typescript\n// Coach's personal notes/relationships - travels with them\n{\n  recruitId: \"...\",\n  coachId: \"coach_user_id\", // Personal to the coach\n  personalData: {\n    relationship: \"strong\",\n    privateNotes: \"Met family at camp...\",\n    personalRating: 5.0,\n    communicationHistory: [...],\n    connectionType: \"club_coach_referral\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\n**While at University XYZ:**\n- Coach sees **both** program data (via org) AND their personal notes\n- Program data is shared with all coaches in the org\n- Personal notes are private to individual coach\n\n**When Coach Moves to University ABC:**\n1. Remove from XYZ organization (loses access to XYZ's official evaluations)\n2. **Keeps** all personal notes, relationships, and contact history\n3. Joins ABC organization, can now link their personal recruits to new program\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n```typescript\n// Data structure for recruits\n{\n  // Shared/Official (organization-scoped)\n  programEvaluations: [\n    {\n      organizationId: \"org_xyz\",\n      rating: 4.5,\n      officialNotes: \"Strong arm, needs work on footwork\",\n      offers: [\"scholarship_offered\"]\n    }\n  ],\n  \n  // Personal (coach-scoped)\n  coachConnections: [\n    {\n      coachId: \"coach_123\",\n      privateNotes: \"Father played at my alma mater\",\n      relationshipStrength: \"high\",\n      personalTags: [\"family_connection\", \"priority\"],\n      communicationLog: [...]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## UI Considerations\n\n**Coach Dashboard:**\n- **\"Program Recruits\"** tab: All recruits being evaluated by XYZ Football (org level)\n- **\"My Recruits\"** tab: Coach's personal recruiting network (follows them)\n- **\"Shared\"** badge: Recruits that appear in both lists\n\n**Privacy Controls:**\n- Coaches can choose what to share with program vs keep private\n- Toggle: \"Add to [University XYZ] program board\" when they want to officially introduce a recruit\n\n## Benefits\n\n✅ Programs maintain institutional knowledge  \n✅ Coaches build portable professional networks  \n✅ Recruits benefit from continuity when coaches move  \n✅ Prevents loss of relationships during staff changes  \n✅ Clear separation of institutional vs personal data\n\nThis is similar to how LinkedIn works - your connections are yours, but company data stays with the company."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":4,"cache_creation_input_tokens":486,"cache_read_input_tokens":19196,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":486,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":758,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CTpXTQheUHwH1oHBGfqtF","type":"assistant","uuid":"d964b681-a6aa-4a17-a718-8d4e99472e04","timestamp":"2025-10-05T18:29:30.249Z"}
