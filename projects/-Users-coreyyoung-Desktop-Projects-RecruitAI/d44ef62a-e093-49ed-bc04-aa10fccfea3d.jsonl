AthletePositionView.swift\n   - AthletePhysicalStatsView.swift\n   - AthleteContactInfoView.swift\n\n   **Problems:**\n   - Extensive use of hardcoded colors: `Color.blue`, `Color.gray`, `.primary`\n   - Should use `theme.color(.primary)`, `theme.color(.mutedforeground)`, etc.\n   - Use `Color(.systemGray6)` instead of `.glassCard()` modifier\n   - Hardcoded progress bar colors\n   - Hardcoded spacing throughout (24, 40, 12, etc.)\n\n2. **CollegeCoachFeedView.swift:**\n   - Multiple hardcoded colors for icon colors\n   - Hardcoded `.white` and `.blue`\n   - Should use theme color system consistently\n\n### Major Issues (Should Fix)\n\n1. **Inconsistent Padding Values:**\n   - Many screens use `padding(.horizontal, 24)` instead of `.spacing6`\n   - Many use `padding(.bottom, 40)` instead of `.spacing10`\n   - Some use `padding(10)` instead of `.spacing3`\n\n2. **Inconsistent Foreground Color Usage:**\n   - Mix of `.foregroundColor()` and `.foregroundStyle()`\n   - Should standardize on `.foregroundStyle()` (SwiftUI modern approach)\n\n3. **AthleteProfileSetupView.swift:**\n   - FormField component uses hardcoded spacing\n   - Should be refactored to use spacing tokens throughout\n\n4. **CollegeCoachProfileView.swift:**\n   - Custom components have hardcoded values\n   - StatsBarView uses `Color(.systemBackground)` instead of theme color\n   - ExpandableSection has hardcoded sizes\n\n### Minor Issues (Nice to Have)\n\n1. **SignInView, SignUpAuthView, UserTypeSelectionView:**\n   - Consistent pattern of using 24 and 40 for padding\n   - Should migrate to spacing tokens for full compliance\n\n2. **AthleteFeedView:**\n   - One instance of hardcoded `.blue`\n   - Otherwise excellent\n\n3. **ProfileView:**\n   - Some hardcoded spacing and frame values\n   - Generally good use of design system\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations\n\n### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)\n\n1. **Fix Athlete Onboarding Screens:**\n   ```swift\n   // BEFORE\n   .foregroundColor(.blue)\n   .background(Color.blue)\n   .foregroundColor(.gray)\n   .background(Color(.systemGray6))\n\n   // AFTER\n   .foregroundStyle(theme.color(.primary))\n   .background(theme.color(.primary))\n   .foregroundStyle(theme.color(.mutedforeground))\n   .glassCard(cornerRadius: .radiusMedium, padding: .spacing4)\n   ```\n\n2. **Update CollegeCoachFeedView Colors:**\n   ```swift\n   // BEFORE\n   iconColor: .blue\n\n   // AFTER\n   iconColor: theme.color(.primary)\n   ```\n\n3. **Create Reusable Components:**\n   -

AthletePositionView.swift\n   - AthletePhysicalStatsView.swift\n   - AthleteContactInfoView.swift\n\n   **Problems:**\n   - Extensive use of hardcoded colors: `Color.blue`, `Color.gray`, `.primary`\n   - Should use `theme.color(.primary)`, `theme.color(.mutedforeground)`, etc.\n   - Use `Color(.systemGray6)` instead of `.glassCard()` modifier\n   - Hardcoded progress bar colors\n   - Hardcoded spacing throughout (24, 40, 12, etc.)\n\n2. **CollegeCoachFeedView.swift:**\n   - Multiple hardcoded colors for icon colors\n   - Hardcoded `.white` and `.blue`\n   - Should use theme color system consistently\n\n### Major Issues (Should Fix)\n\n1. **Inconsistent Padding Values:**\n   - Many screens use `padding(.horizontal, 24)` instead of `.spacing6`\n   - Many use `padding(.bottom, 40)` instead of `.spacing10`\n   - Some use `padding(10)` instead of `.spacing3`\n\n2. **Inconsistent Foreground Color Usage:**\n   - Mix of `.foregroundColor()` and `.foregroundStyle()`\n   - Should standardize on `.foregroundStyle()` (SwiftUI modern approach)\n\n3. **AthleteProfileSetupView.swift:**\n   - FormField component uses hardcoded spacing\n   - Should be refactored to use spacing tokens throughout\n\n4. **CollegeCoachProfileView.swift:**\n   - Custom components have hardcoded values\n   - StatsBarView uses `Color(.systemBackground)` instead of theme color\n   - ExpandableSection has hardcoded sizes\n\n### Minor Issues (Nice to Have)\n\n1. **SignInView, SignUpAuthView, UserTypeSelectionView:**\n   - Consistent pattern of using 24 and 40 for padding\n   - Should migrate to spacing tokens for full compliance\n\n2. **AthleteFeedView:**\n   - One instance of hardcoded `.blue`\n   - Otherwise excellent\n\n3. **ProfileView:**\n   - Some hardcoded spacing and frame values\n   - Generally good use of design system\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations\n\n### Immediate Actions (Priority 1)\n\n1. **Fix Athlete Onboarding Screens:**\n   ```swift\n   // BEFORE\n   .foregroundColor(.blue)\n   .background(Color.blue)\n   .foregroundColor(.gray)\n   .background(Color(.systemGray6))\n\n   // AFTER\n   .foregroundStyle(theme.color(.primary))\n   .background(theme.color(.primary))\n   .foregroundStyle(theme.color(.mutedforeground))\n   .glassCard(cornerRadius: .radiusMedium, padding: .spacing4)\n   ```\n\n2. **Update CollegeCoachFeedView Colors:**\n   ```swift\n   // BEFORE\n   iconColor: .blue\n\n   // AFTER\n   iconColor: theme.color(.primary)\n   ```\n\n3. **Create Reusable Components:**\n   -
