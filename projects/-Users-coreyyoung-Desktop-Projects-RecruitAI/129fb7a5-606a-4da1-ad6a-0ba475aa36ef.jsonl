It advises limiting the number of effects and using Instruments for UI performance analysis.\n\nSOURCE: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/documentation/swiftui/applying-liquid-glass-to-custom-views\n\nLANGUAGE: APIDOC\nCODE:\n```\n## Optimize performance when using Liquid Glass effects\n\nCreating too many Liquid Glass effect containers and applying too many effects to views outside of containers can degrade performance. Limit the use of Liquid Glass effects onscreen at the same time. Additionally, optimize how your app spends rendering time as people use it. To learn how to improve the performance of your UI, see Explore UI animation hitches and the render loop and Optimize SwiftUI performance with Instruments.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n- **Limit Concurrent Effects**: Reduce the number of Liquid Glass effects displayed simultaneously.\n- **Profile Performance**: Utilize Instruments, specifically \"Core Animation\" and \"SwiftUI Performance\", to identify and resolve UI animation hitches and render loop issues.\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Apply custom Liquid Glass effect to badges in SwiftUI\nDESCRIPTION: This code illustrates how to create custom Liquid Glass badges using SwiftUI. It utilizes a view with an Image for the badge, a background hexagon Image, and a custom color fill. The `glassEffect(_:in:)` modifier is applied to achieve the Liquid Glass effect.\n\nSOURCE: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/documentation/swiftui/landmarks-building-an-app-with-liquid-glass\n\nLANGUAGE: swift\nCODE:\n```\nImage(systemName: \"star.fill\")\n  .background(Image(\"hexagon\").fill(Color.blue))\n  .glassEffect(\n    in: .init(size: CGSize(width: 100, height: 100)),\n    ignoresInWindowGroup: false\n  )\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Morph Liquid Glass effects during transitions\nDESCRIPTION: Demonstrates how to use `glassEffectID(_:in:)` and `GlassEffectTransition` for morphing effects between views with Liquid Glass. It shows an example of morphing an eraser image into a pencil image based on a state change.\n\nSOURCE: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/documentation/swiftui/applying-liquid-glass-to-custom-views\n\nLANGUAGE: APIDOC\nCODE:\n```\n## Morph Liquid Glass effects during transitions\n\nMorphing effects occur during transitions or animations between views with Liquid Glass effects. Coordinate transitions between views with effects in a container by using the `glassEffectID(_:in:)` modifier. `GlassEffectTransition` allows you to specify the type of transition to use when you want to add or remove effects within a container. For effects you want to add or remove that are positioned within the container’s assigned spacing, the default transition type is `matchedGeometry`.\n\nIf you prefer to have a simpler transition or to create a custom transition, use the `materialize` transition and `withAnimation(_:_:)`. Use the `materialize` transition for effects you want to add or remove that are farther from each other than the container’s assigned spacing. To provide people with a consistent experience, use `matchedGeometry` and `materialize` transitions across your apps. The system applies more than opacity changes with the available transition types.\n\nAssociate each Liquid Glass effect with a unique identifier within a namespace that the `Namespace` property wrapper provides. These IDs ensure SwiftUI animates the same shapes correctly when a shape appears or disappears due to view hierarchy changes. SwiftUI uses the spacing provided to the effect container along with the geometry of the shapes themselves to determine when and which appropriate shapes to morph into and out of.\n\nThe `glassEffectID(_:in:)` and `glassEffectTransition(_:)` modifiers only affect their content during view hierarchy transitions or animations.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```swift\nimport SwiftUI\n\nstruct ContentView: View {\n    @State private var isExpanded: Bool = false\n    @Namespace private var namespace\n\n    var body: some View {\n        VStack {\n            GlassEffectContainer(spacing: 40.0) {\n                HStack(spacing: 40.0) {\n                    Image(systemName: \"scribble.variable\")\n                        .frame(width: 80.0, height: 80.0)\n                        .font(.system(size: 36))\n                        .glassEffect()\n                        .glassEffectID(\"pencil\", in: namespace)\n\n                    if isExpanded {\n                        Image(systemName: \"eraser.fill\")\n                            .frame(width: 80.0, height: 80.0)\n                            .font(.system(size: 36))\n                            .glassEffect()\n                            .glassEffectID(\"eraser\", in: namespace)\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n            Button(\"Toggle\") {\n                withAnimation {\n                    isExpanded.toggle()\n                }\n            }\n            .buttonStyle(.glass)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Preview Provider\nstruct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {\n    static var previews: some View {\n        ContentView()\n    }\n}\n\n// Extension for Glass button style\nextension ButtonStyle where Self == GlassButtonStyle {\n    static var glass: GlassButtonStyle { GlassButtonStyle() }\n}\n```\n\n### Modifiers\n\n- `glassEffectID(_:in:)`: Associates a Liquid Glass effect with a unique identifier within a namespace for correct animation during view hierarchy transitions.\n- `glassEffectTransition(_:)`: Specifies the transition type for adding or removing effects within a container.\n\n### Key Structures\n\n- `GlassEffectContainer`: A view that enables morphing between multiple Liquid Glass shapes.\n- `GlassEffectTransition`: Defines changes applied when a glass effect is added or removed.\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Glass Structure\nDESCRIPTION: Defines the configuration for the Liquid Glass material effect in SwiftUI.\n\nSOURCE: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/documentation/swiftui/glass\n\nLANGUAGE: APIDOC\nCODE:\n```\n## struct Glass\n\n### Description\nA structure that defines the configuration of the Liquid Glass material.\n\n### Usage\nYou provide instances of a variant of Liquid Glass to the `glassEffect(_:in:)` view modifier.\n\n```swift\nText(\"Hello, World!\")\n    .font(.title)\n    .padding()\n    .glassEffect()\n```\n\nYou can combine Liquid Glass effects using a `GlassEffectContainer`.\n\n### Instance Methods\n- `func interactive(Bool) -> Glass`: Returns a copy of the structure configured to be interactive.\n- `func tint(Color?) -> Glass`: Returns a copy of the structure with a configured tint color.\n\n### Type Properties\n- `static var clear: Glass`: The clear variant of glass.\n- `static var identity: Glass`: The identity variant of glass.

Coordinate transitions between views with effects in a container by using the `glassEffectID(_:in:)` modifier. `GlassEffectTransition` allows you to specify the type of transition to use when you want to add or remove effects within a container. For effects you want to add or remove that are positioned within the container’s assigned spacing, the default transition type is `matchedGeometry`.\n\nIf you prefer to have a simpler transition or to create a custom transition, use the `materialize` transition and `withAnimation(_:_:)`. Use the `materialize` transition for effects you want to add or remove that are farther from each other than the container’s assigned spacing. To provide people with a consistent experience, use `matchedGeometry` and `materialize` transitions across your apps. The system applies more than opacity changes with the available transition types.\n\nAssociate each Liquid Glass effect with a unique identifier within a namespace that the `Namespace` property wrapper provides. These IDs ensure SwiftUI animates the same shapes correctly when a shape appears or disappears due to view hierarchy changes. SwiftUI uses the spacing provided to the effect container along with the geometry of the shapes themselves to determine when and which appropriate shapes to morph into and out of.\n\nThe `glassEffectID(_:in:)` and `glassEffectTransition(_:)` modifiers only affect their content during view hierarchy transitions or animations.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```swift\nimport SwiftUI\n\nstruct ContentView: View {\n    @State private var isExpanded: Bool = false\n    @Namespace private var namespace\n\n    var body: some View {\n        VStack {\n            GlassEffectContainer(spacing: 40.0) {\n                HStack(spacing: 40.0) {\n                    Image(systemName: \"scribble.variable\")\n                        .frame(width: 80.0, height: 80.0)\n                        .font(.system(size: 36))\n                        .glassEffect()\n                        .glassEffectID(\"pencil\", in: namespace)\n\n                    if isExpanded {\n                        Image(systemName: \"eraser.fill\")\n                            .frame(width: 80.0, height: 80.0)\n                            .font(.system(size: 36))\n                            .glassEffect()\n                            .glassEffectID(\"eraser\", in: namespace)\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n            Button(\"Toggle\") {\n                withAnimation {\n                    isExpanded.toggle()\n                }\n            }\n            .buttonStyle(.glass)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Preview Provider\nstruct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {\n    static var previews: some View {\n        ContentView()\n    }\n}\n\n// Extension for Glass button style\nextension ButtonStyle where Self == GlassButtonStyle {\n    static var glass: GlassButtonStyle { GlassButtonStyle() }\n}\n```\n\n### Modifiers\n\n- `glassEffectID(_:in:)`: Associates a Liquid Glass effect with a unique identifier within a namespace for correct animation during view hierarchy transitions.\n- `glassEffectTransition(_:)`: Specifies the transition type for adding or removing effects within a container.\n\n### Key Structures\n\n- `GlassEffectContainer`: A view that enables morphing between multiple Liquid Glass shapes.\n- `GlassEffectTransition`: Defines changes applied when a glass effect is added or removed.\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTITLE: Glass Structure\nDESCRIPTION: Defines the configuration for the Liquid Glass material effect in SwiftUI.\n\nSOURCE: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/documentation/swiftui/glass\n\nLANGUAGE: APIDOC\nCODE:\n```\n## struct Glass\n\n### Description\nA structure that defines the configuration of the Liquid Glass material.\n\n### Usage\nYou provide instances of a variant of Liquid Glass to the `glassEffect(_:in:)` view modifier.\n\n```swift\nText(\"Hello, World!\")\n    .font(.title)\n    .padding()\n    .glassEffect()\n```\n\nYou can combine Liquid Glass effects using a `GlassEffectContainer`.\n\n### Instance Methods\n- `func interactive(Bool) -> Glass`: Returns a copy of the structure configured to be interactive.\n- `func tint(Color?) -> Glass`: Returns a copy of the structure with a configured tint color.\n\n### Type Properties\n- `static var clear: Glass`: The clear variant of glass.\n- `static var identity: Glass`: The identity variant of glass.

The higher the spacing, the sooner blending begins as the shapes approach each other.\n\n### Initializers\n#### `init(spacing: CGFloat?, content: () -> Content)`\nCreates a glass effect container with the provided spacing, extracting glass shapes from the provided content.\n\n### Relationships\n#### Conforms To\n* `Sendable`\n* `SendableMetatype`\n* `View`\n\n### See Also\n* **Styling views with Liquid Glass**: Applying Liquid Glass to custom views\n* **Landmarks: Building an app with Liquid Glass**: Enhance your app experience with system-provided and custom Liquid Glass.\n\n## Modifiers and Related Types\n\n### `func glassEffect(Glass, in: some Shape) -> some View`\nApplies the Liquid Glass effect to a view.\n\n### `func interactive(Bool) -> Glass`\nReturns a copy of the structure configured to be interactive.\n\n### `struct GlassEffectTransition`\nA structure that describes changes to apply when a glass effect is added or removed from the view hierarchy.\n\n### `struct GlassButtonStyle`\nA button style that applies glass border artwork based on the button’s context.\n\n### `struct GlassProminentButtonStyle`\nA button style that applies prominent glass border artwork based on the button’s context.\n\n### `struct DefaultGlassEffectShape`\nThe default shape applied by glass effects, a capsule.\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTITLE: SwiftUI glassBackgroundEffect(_:displayMode:)\nDESCRIPTION: Applies a custom glass background effect to a SwiftUI view. This effect can include thickness, specularity, blur, and shadows. It's recommended to apply this modifier to a ZStack for proper rendering, especially within collections of views.\n\nSOURCE: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/documentation/swiftui/view/glassbackgroundeffect%28_%3Adisplaymode%3A%29\n\nLANGUAGE: swift\nCODE:\n```\nnonisolated\nfunc glassBackgroundEffect<S>(\n    _ effect: S,\n    displayMode: GlassBackgroundDisplayMode = .always\n) -> some View where S : GlassBackgroundEffect\n\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\nTITLE: SwiftUI Glass Background Effect\nDESCRIPTION: Applies an automatic glass background effect to a SwiftUI view.

Create `LiquidGlassCard.swift` alongside existing `GlassCard.swift`\n2. Create glass button style wrappers\n3. Add `GlassEffectContainer` wrapper components\n4. Update DesignSystem.swift with Liquid Glass documentation\n\n### Phase 2: Update Existing Components\n1. **GlassCard.swift**: Add deprecation warning, point to `LiquidGlassCard`\n2. **BrandButton.swift**: Add `.glass` style option alongside existing styles\n3. Test across all 20+ files currently using glass/overlay cards\n\n### Phase 3: Adopt in Views (Gradual)\nPrioritize views with:\n- Multiple interactive cards (for morphing effects)\n- Button-heavy interfaces (glass button styles)\n- Feed/profile cards (visual polish)\n\n### Phase 4: Performance Optimization\n- Use `GlassEffectContainer` to group effects (reduces render passes)\n- Profile with Instruments (Core Animation template)\n- Limit concurrent effects per screen (Apple recommendation)\n\n---\n\n## API Changes Summary\n\n| Current API | Liquid Glass Replacement | Notes |\n|-------------|-------------------------|-------|\n| `.fill(material)` | `.glassEffect(.regular)` | Core change |\n| `.background(Material)` | `.glassEffect()` | For cards only |\n| Custom button styling | `.buttonStyle(.glass)` | System-provided |\n| N/A | `GlassEffectContainer` | New grouping container |\n| N/A | `.glassEffectID(_:in:)` | For morphing animations |\n| N/A | `.interactive()` | Touch feedback |\n| N/A | `.tint(Color)` | Glass colorization |\n\n---\n\n## Files Impacted (20+ files use current glass components)\n\n**High Priority:**\n- `GlassCard.swift` - Core component\n- `BrandButton.swift` - Buttons across app\n- `PhotoOverlayCard.swift` - Decision needed\n\n**Medium Priority (Currently using glass/overlay):**\n- Profile views (Athlete, Coach, Parent)\n- Feed views\n- Search views\n- Auth flows\n\n---\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n⚠️ **Apple's Warning:** Creating too many Liquid Glass effects can degrade performance\n\n**Best Practices:**\n1. Group effects in `GlassEffectContainer` when possible\n2. Limit to 3-5 concurrent glass effects per screen\n3. Use Instruments to profile render time\n4. Consider `.clear` variant for less intensive rendering\n\n---\n\n## Minimum Requirements\n\n- **iOS 26.0+** (Liquid Glass APIs)\n- **Xcode 26** for building\n- **Swift 6** (concurrency support for `@MainActor`)\n\n---\n\n## Recommendation Priority\n\n### 🔴 Critical (Do First)\n1. Create new `LiquidGlassCard.swift` component\n2. Update `GlassCard.swift` with glass effects\n3. Add glass button styles to `BrandButton.swift`\n\n### 🟡 Important (Do Soon)\n4. Create `GlassEffectContainer` wrapper utilities\n5. Add morphing animation examples\n6. Update documentation with usage guidelines\n\n### 🟢 Nice to Have\n7. Migrate `PhotoOverlayCard` (evaluate first)\n8. Add glass backgrounds option\n9. Create preview playground for all glass variants\n\n---\n\n## Next Steps\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. **Implement the new LiquidGlassCard component?**\n2. **Update GlassCard.swift with glass effects?**\n3. **Create a migration guide for your team?**\n4. **Add glass button styles to BrandButton?**\n5. **Set up a demo view showcasing all glass variants?**\n\nLet me know which direction you'd like to take!"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":8,"cache_creation_input_tokens":5998,"cache_read_input_tokens":49845,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":5998,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2120,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CTwdqW8AxiwHKrebYJWEv","type":"assistant","uuid":"99ad9466-c019-48d0-b9dd-66d03b3faee5","timestamp":"2025-10-09T12:37:47.707Z"}

[Rollback Plan](#rollback-plan)\n\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nApple introduced Liquid Glass at WWDC 2025 as a new design system that brings depth, vibrancy, and fluid interactions to iOS 26+. This document outlines the migration path for RecruitAI's iOS app to adopt Liquid Glass while maintaining backward compatibility and app stability.\n\n### Goals\n\n- ✅ Modernize UI with Liquid Glass effects\n- ✅ Maintain existing functionality during migration\n- ✅ Ensure performance remains optimal\n- ✅ Provide clear migration path for team\n- ✅ Support gradual rollout (no big-bang changes)\n\n### Requirements\n\n- **Minimum iOS Version:** iOS 26.0+\n- **Xcode Version:** Xcode 26+\n- **Swift Version:** Swift 6+\n- **Testing Devices:** iPhone 15+ (recommended for Display P3 + Glass effects)\n\n---\n\n## What is Liquid Glass?\n\n### Core Concepts\n\nLiquid Glass is a dynamic material that combines:\n\n- **Optical Properties:** Refracts content below, reflects light around, lensing effects on edges\n- **Vibrancy:** Adapts to surrounding content for depth and connection\n- **Fluidity:** Morphing animations between glass shapes\n- **Two Variants:**\n  - **Regular:** Most versatile, adaptive, maintains legibility in any context\n  - **Clear:** More transparent, shows richness of content underneath\n\n### Key Benefits\n\n1. **Modern Aesthetic:** Aligned with iOS 26 design language\n2. **System Integration:** Follows platform conventions\n3. **Accessibility:** Built-in contrast and readability\n4. **Performance:** Optimized rendering when used correctly\n5. **Interactive Feedback:** Native touch/pointer response\n\n---\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n### Existing Components\n\n#### 1. **GlassCard.swift** ⚠️ NEEDS MAJOR UPDATE\n\n**Current Implementation:**\n```swift\n// Uses solid color fills - NOT Liquid Glass\nRoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: cornerRadius, style: .continuous)\n    .fill(theme.color(.card))\n    .overlay(\n        RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: cornerRadius, style: .continuous)\n            .stroke(theme.color(.border).opacity(0.3), lineWidth: 1)\n    )\n```\n\n**Issues:**\n- Uses solid fills instead of glass effects\n- No optical properties (refraction, reflection)\n- Custom borders instead of system-provided glass edges\n- Missing interactive capabilities\n\n**Impact:** Used in **15+ view files** across the app\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **PhotoOverlayCard.swift** ℹ️ EVALUATE\n\n**Current Implementation:**\n```swift\n// Uses legacy Material types\n.background(\n    RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: cornerRadius, style: .continuous)\n        .fill(material) // .ultraThinMaterial, .regularMaterial, etc.\n)\n```\n\n**Status:**\n- Materials are still valid for specific use cases\n- Consider keeping for photo overlays OR migrating to `.glassEffect(.clear)`\n\n**Decision Required:** Keep Materials vs. Migrate to Liquid Glass\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **BrandButton.swift** ⚠️ NEEDS UPDATE\n\n**Current Implementation:**\n```swift\n// Manual button styling with custom backgrounds\n.background(backgroundColor)\n.clipShape(RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: .radiusLarge, style: .continuous))\n.shadow(color: shadowColor, radius: 8, y: 4)\n```\n\n**Recommended:**\n```swift\nButton(\"Action\") { }\n    .buttonStyle(.glass)\n    // or\n    .buttonStyle(.glassProminent)\n```\n\n**Impact:** Buttons used throughout app (auth, profiles, feeds, etc.)\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **BrandBackground.swift** ✅ OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT\n\n**Current:** Linear gradients for backgrounds\n**Enhancement:** Add `.glassBackgroundEffect()` option\n\n---\n\n### Files Using Current Glass Components (20+ Files)\n\n**Athlete Views:**\n- `AthleteFeedView.swift`\n- `ProfileView.swift`\n- `AboutView.swift`\n- `AcademicsView.swift`\n- `AthleticsView.swift`\n- `FilmView.swift`\n- `PublicProfileView.swift`\n- `AthleteSearchView.swift`\n- `AthleteProfileSetupView.swift`\n\n**Coach Views:**\n- `CollegeCoachProfileView.swift`\n- `CoachProfileSetupView.swift`\n\n**Parent Views:**\n- `ParentProfileSetupView.swift`\n\n**Shared Components:**\n- `FeedPost.swift`\n- `MenuItem.swift`\n- `LoadingView.swift`\n- `MessagesView.swift`\n\n**Auth Views:**\n- `UserTypeSelectionView.swift`\n- `SignUpAuthView.swift`\n\n---\n\n## Migration Strategy\n\n### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)\n\n**Goal:** Add new Liquid Glass components without breaking existing code\n\n#### Tasks\n\n1. **Create LiquidGlassCard.swift**\n   ```swift\n   struct LiquidGlassCard<Content: View>: View {\n       let content: Content\n       var glass: Glass = .regular\n       var cornerRadius: CGFloat = .radiusLarge\n       var padding: CGFloat = .spacing4\n\n       var body: some View {\n           content\n               .padding(padding)\n               .glassEffect(glass, in: .rect(cornerRadius: cornerRadius))\n       }\n   }\n\n   extension View {\n       func liquidGlassCard(\n           glass: Glass = .regular,\n           cornerRadius: CGFloat = .radiusLarge,\n           padding: CGFloat = .spacing4\n       ) -> some View {\n           modifier(LiquidGlassCardModifier(\n               glass: glass,\n               cornerRadius: cornerRadius,\n               padding: padding\n           ))\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Create GlassEffectContainerWrapper.swift**\n   ```swift\n   struct AnimatedGlassContainer<Content: View>: View {\n       let spacing: CGFloat\n       @ViewBuilder let content: () -> Content\n\n       var body: some View {\n           GlassEffectContainer(spacing: spacing) {\n               content()\n           }\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Update BrandButton with Glass Styles**\n   ```swift\n   enum ButtonStyle {\n       case primary\n       case secondary\n       case destructive\n       case outline\n       case glass          // NEW\n       case glassProminent // NEW\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Documentation**\n   -

Add deprecation, implement glass effects\n2. **BrandButton.swift** - Add glass button styles\n3. **DesignSystem.swift** - Add Liquid Glass documentation\n4. **20+ view files** - Gradual migration\n\n---\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n### Apple's Guidelines\n\n⚠️ **Warning:** Creating too many Liquid Glass effects can degrade performance.\n\n### Best Practices\n\n1. **Limit Concurrent Effects**\n   - Maximum 3-5 glass effects visible simultaneously\n   - Group effects in `GlassEffectContainer` when possible\n   - Use `.clear` variant for lighter rendering\n\n2. **Grouping Strategy**\n   ```swift\n   // GOOD - Grouped effects\n   GlassEffectContainer(spacing: 40.0) {\n       VStack {\n           Card1().glassEffect()\n           Card2().glassEffect()\n           Card3().glassEffect()\n       }\n   }\n\n   // BAD - Scattered effects\n   VStack {\n       Card1().glassEffect()\n       Spacer()\n       Card2().glassEffect()\n       Spacer()\n       Card3().glassEffect()\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Profile with Instruments**\n   - Use Core Animation template\n   - Look for \"Animation Hitches\"\n   - Target 60fps (16.67ms per frame)\n\n4. **Optimization Techniques**\n   - Cache complex views\n   - Minimize effect transitions\n   - Use `.identity` transition for simple fade in/out\n   - Prefer `.materialize` for distant elements\n\n### Performance Metrics\n\n**Target Benchmarks:**\n- View load time: < 100ms\n- Animation frame rate: 60fps\n- Memory usage: < 50MB increase\n- CPU usage: < 20% during interactions\n\n---\n\n## Testing & Validation\n\n### Testing Checklist\n\n#### Visual Testing\n- [ ] Light mode appearance\n- [ ] Dark mode appearance\n- [ ] All glass variants (regular, clear)\n- [ ] Interactive states (tap, hover)\n- [ ] Morphing animations\n- [ ] Various background contexts\n\n#### Performance Testing\n- [ ] Instruments profiling (Core Animation)\n- [ ] Frame rate monitoring (60fps target)\n- [ ] Memory profiling\n- [ ] Battery impact testing\n\n#### Accessibility Testing\n- [ ] VoiceOver navigation\n- [ ] Dynamic Type scaling\n- [ ] Contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)\n- [ ] Reduce Motion support\n- [ ] Color accessibility (color blindness)\n\n#### Device Testing\n- [ ] iPhone 15 Pro (recommended)\n- [ ] iPhone 14 (baseline)\n- [ ] iPad Pro (if applicable)\n- [ ] Various screen sizes\n\n#### Functional Testing\n- [ ] All interactions still work\n- [ ] No regressions in existing features\n- [ ] Smooth animations\n- [ ] Proper layout on all screens\n\n---\n\n## Rollback Plan\n\n### If Issues Arise\n\n1. **Immediate Rollback**\n   - Keep old `GlassCard` implementation active\n   - Use feature flags for Liquid Glass adoption\n   - Quick toggle to disable new effects\n\n2. **Feature Flag Implementation**\n   ```swift\n   struct FeatureFlags {\n       static let useLiquidGlass = false // Toggle as needed\n   }\n\n   var body: some View {\n       if FeatureFlags.useLiquidGlass {\n           content.liquidGlassCard()\n       } else {\n           content.glassCard()\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Gradual Rollout**\n   - Enable for internal testing first\n   - Beta testing with select users\n   - Gradual percentage rollout (10% → 50% → 100%)\n\n4. **Monitoring**\n   - Track crash rates\n   - Monitor performance metrics\n   - Collect user feedback\n\n---\n\n## FAQs\n\n### Q: Do we need to migrate everything at once?\n**A:** No. The migration strategy is designed for gradual adoption.

This document outlines the migration path for RecruitAI's iOS app to adopt Liquid Glass while maintaining backward compatibility and app stability.\n\n### Goals\n\n- ✅ Modernize UI with Liquid Glass effects\n- ✅ Maintain existing functionality during migration\n- ✅ Ensure performance remains optimal\n- ✅ Provide clear migration path for team\n- ✅ Support gradual rollout (no big-bang changes)\n\n### Requirements\n\n- **Minimum iOS Version:** iOS 26.0+\n- **Xcode Version:** Xcode 26+\n- **Swift Version:** Swift 6+\n- **Testing Devices:** iPhone 15+ (recommended for Display P3 + Glass effects)\n\n---\n\n## What is Liquid Glass?\n\n### Core Concepts\n\nLiquid Glass is a dynamic material that combines:\n\n- **Optical Properties:** Refracts content below, reflects light around, lensing effects on edges\n- **Vibrancy:** Adapts to surrounding content for depth and connection\n- **Fluidity:** Morphing animations between glass shapes\n- **Two Variants:**\n  - **Regular:** Most versatile, adaptive, maintains legibility in any context\n  - **Clear:** More transparent, shows richness of content underneath\n\n### Key Benefits\n\n1. **Modern Aesthetic:** Aligned with iOS 26 design language\n2. **System Integration:** Follows platform conventions\n3. **Accessibility:** Built-in contrast and readability\n4. **Performance:** Optimized rendering when used correctly\n5. **Interactive Feedback:** Native touch/pointer response\n\n---\n\n## Current State Analysis\n\n### Existing Components\n\n#### 1. **GlassCard.swift** ⚠️ NEEDS MAJOR UPDATE\n\n**Current Implementation:**\n```swift\n// Uses solid color fills - NOT Liquid Glass\nRoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: cornerRadius, style: .continuous)\n    .fill(theme.color(.card))\n    .overlay(\n        RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: cornerRadius, style: .continuous)\n            .stroke(theme.color(.border).opacity(0.3), lineWidth: 1)\n    )\n```\n\n**Issues:**\n- Uses solid fills instead of glass effects\n- No optical properties (refraction, reflection)\n- Custom borders instead of system-provided glass edges\n- Missing interactive capabilities\n\n**Impact:** Used in **15+ view files** across the app\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **PhotoOverlayCard.swift** ℹ️ EVALUATE\n\n**Current Implementation:**\n```swift\n// Uses legacy Material types\n.background(\n    RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: cornerRadius, style: .continuous)\n        .fill(material) // .ultraThinMaterial, .regularMaterial, etc.\n)\n```\n\n**Status:**\n- Materials are still valid for specific use cases\n- Consider keeping for photo overlays OR migrating to `.glassEffect(.clear)`\n\n**Decision Required:** Keep Materials vs. Migrate to Liquid Glass\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **BrandButton.swift** ⚠️ NEEDS UPDATE\n\n**Current Implementation:**\n```swift\n// Manual button styling with custom backgrounds\n.background(backgroundColor)\n.clipShape(RoundedRectangle(cornerRadius: .radiusLarge, style: .continuous))\n.shadow(color: shadowColor, radius: 8, y: 4)\n```\n\n**Recommended:**\n```swift\nButton(\"Action\") { }\n    .buttonStyle(.glass)\n    // or\n    .buttonStyle(.glassProminent)\n```\n\n**Impact:** Buttons used throughout app (auth, profiles, feeds, etc.)\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **BrandBackground.swift** ✅ OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT\n\n**Current:** Linear gradients for backgrounds\n**Enhancement:** Add `.glassBackgroundEffect()` option\n\n---\n\n### Files Using Current Glass Components (20+ Files)\n\n**Athlete Views:**\n- `AthleteFeedView.swift`\n- `ProfileView.swift`\n- `AboutView.swift`\n- `AcademicsView.swift`\n- `AthleticsView.swift`\n- `FilmView.swift`\n- `PublicProfileView.swift`\n- `AthleteSearchView.swift`\n- `AthleteProfileSetupView.swift`\n\n**Coach Views:**\n- `CollegeCoachProfileView.swift`\n- `CoachProfileSetupView.swift`\n\n**Parent Views:**\n- `ParentProfileSetupView.swift`\n\n**Shared Components:**\n- `FeedPost.swift`\n- `MenuItem.swift`\n- `LoadingView.swift`\n- `MessagesView.swift`\n\n**Auth Views:**\n- `UserTypeSelectionView.swift`\n- `SignUpAuthView.swift`\n\n---\n\n## Migration Strategy\n\n### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)\n\n**Goal:** Add new Liquid Glass components without breaking existing code\n\n#### Tasks\n\n1. **Create LiquidGlassCard.swift**\n   ```swift\n   struct LiquidGlassCard<Content: View>: View {\n       let content: Content\n       var glass: Glass = .regular\n       var cornerRadius: CGFloat = .radiusLarge\n       var padding: CGFloat = .spacing4\n\n       var body: some View {\n           content\n               .padding(padding)\n               .glassEffect(glass, in: .rect(cornerRadius: cornerRadius))\n       }\n   }\n\n   extension View {\n       func liquidGlassCard(\n           glass: Glass = .regular,\n           cornerRadius: CGFloat = .radiusLarge,\n           padding: CGFloat = .spacing4\n       ) -> some View {\n           modifier(LiquidGlassCardModifier(\n               glass: glass,\n               cornerRadius: cornerRadius,\n               padding: padding\n           ))\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Create GlassEffectContainerWrapper.swift**\n   ```swift\n   struct AnimatedGlassContainer<Content: View>: View {\n       let spacing: CGFloat\n       @ViewBuilder let content: () -> Content\n\n       var body: some View {\n           GlassEffectContainer(spacing: spacing) {\n               content()\n           }\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Update BrandButton with Glass Styles**\n   ```swift\n   enum ButtonStyle {\n       case primary\n       case secondary\n       case destructive\n       case outline\n       case glass          // NEW\n       case glassProminent // NEW\n   }\n   ```\n\n4. **Documentation**\n   -

Add deprecation, implement glass effects\n2. **BrandButton.swift** - Add glass button styles\n3. **DesignSystem.swift** - Add Liquid Glass documentation\n4. **20+ view files** - Gradual migration\n\n---\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n### Apple's Guidelines\n\n⚠️ **Warning:** Creating too many Liquid Glass effects can degrade performance.\n\n### Best Practices\n\n1. **Limit Concurrent Effects**\n   - Maximum 3-5 glass effects visible simultaneously\n   - Group effects in `GlassEffectContainer` when possible\n   - Use `.clear` variant for lighter rendering\n\n2. **Grouping Strategy**\n   ```swift\n   // GOOD - Grouped effects\n   GlassEffectContainer(spacing: 40.0) {\n       VStack {\n           Card1().glassEffect()\n           Card2().glassEffect()\n           Card3().glassEffect()\n       }\n   }\n\n   // BAD - Scattered effects\n   VStack {\n       Card1().glassEffect()\n       Spacer()\n       Card2().glassEffect()\n       Spacer()\n       Card3().glassEffect()\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Profile with Instruments**\n   - Use Core Animation template\n   - Look for \"Animation Hitches\"\n   - Target 60fps (16.67ms per frame)\n\n4. **Optimization Techniques**\n   - Cache complex views\n   - Minimize effect transitions\n   - Use `.identity` transition for simple fade in/out\n   - Prefer `.materialize` for distant elements\n\n### Performance Metrics\n\n**Target Benchmarks:**\n- View load time: < 100ms\n- Animation frame rate: 60fps\n- Memory usage: < 50MB increase\n- CPU usage: < 20% during interactions\n\n---\n\n## Testing & Validation\n\n### Testing Checklist\n\n#### Visual Testing\n- [ ] Light mode appearance\n- [ ] Dark mode appearance\n- [ ] All glass variants (regular, clear)\n- [ ] Interactive states (tap, hover)\n- [ ] Morphing animations\n- [ ] Various background contexts\n\n#### Performance Testing\n- [ ] Instruments profiling (Core Animation)\n- [ ] Frame rate monitoring (60fps target)\n- [ ] Memory profiling\n- [ ] Battery impact testing\n\n#### Accessibility Testing\n- [ ] VoiceOver navigation\n- [ ] Dynamic Type scaling\n- [ ] Contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)\n- [ ] Reduce Motion support\n- [ ] Color accessibility (color blindness)\n\n#### Device Testing\n- [ ] iPhone 15 Pro (recommended)\n- [ ] iPhone 14 (baseline)\n- [ ] iPad Pro (if applicable)\n- [ ] Various screen sizes\n\n#### Functional Testing\n- [ ] All interactions still work\n- [ ] No regressions in existing features\n- [ ] Smooth animations\n- [ ] Proper layout on all screens\n\n---\n\n## Rollback Plan\n\n### If Issues Arise\n\n1. **Immediate Rollback**\n   - Keep old `GlassCard` implementation active\n   - Use feature flags for Liquid Glass adoption\n   - Quick toggle to disable new effects\n\n2. **Feature Flag Implementation**\n   ```swift\n   struct FeatureFlags {\n       static let useLiquidGlass = false // Toggle as needed\n   }\n\n   var body: some View {\n       if FeatureFlags.useLiquidGlass {\n           content.liquidGlassCard()\n       } else {\n           content.glassCard()\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Gradual Rollout**\n   - Enable for internal testing first\n   - Beta testing with select users\n   - Gradual percentage rollout (10% → 50% → 100%)\n\n4. **Monitoring**\n   - Track crash rates\n   - Monitor performance metrics\n   - Collect user feedback\n\n---\n\n## FAQs\n\n### Q: Do we need to migrate everything at once?\n**A:** No. The migration strategy is designed for gradual adoption.
