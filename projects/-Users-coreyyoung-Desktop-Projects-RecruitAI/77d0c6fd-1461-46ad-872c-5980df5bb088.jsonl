Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific\ndomains or tasks—they transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\n│   │   ├── name: (required)\n│   │   └── description: (required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions (required)\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\n    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\n```\n\n#### SKILL.md (required)\n\n**Metadata Quality:** The `name` and `description` in YAML frontmatter determine when Claude will use the skill. Be specific about what the skill does and when to use it. Use the third-person (e.g. \"This skill should be used when...\" instead of \"Use this skill when...\").\n\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Claude for patching or environment-specific adjustments\n\n##### References (`references/`)\n\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.\n\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Claude determines it's needed\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\n\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\n\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.\n\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the final output\n- **Examples**: `assets/logo.png` for brand assets, `assets/slides.pptx` for PowerPoint templates, `assets/frontend-template/` for HTML/React boilerplate, `assets/font.ttf` for typography\n- **Use cases**: Templates, images, icons, boilerplate code, fonts, sample documents that get copied or modified\n- **Benefits**: Separates output resources from documentation, enables Claude to use files without loading them into context\n\n### Progressive Disclosure Design Principle\n\nSkills use a three-level loading system to manage context efficiently:\n\n1. **Metadata (name + description)** - Always in context (~100 words)\n2. **SKILL.md body** - When skill triggers (<5k words)\n3. **Bundled resources** - As needed by Claude (Unlimited*)\n\n*Unlimited because scripts can be executed without reading into context window.\n\n## Skill Creation Process\n\nTo create a skill, follow the \"Skill Creation Process\" in order, skipping steps only if there is a clear reason why they are not applicable.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Skill with Concrete Examples\n\nSkip this step only when the skill's usage patterns are already clearly understood. It remains valuable even when working with an existing skill.\n\nTo create an effective skill, clearly understand concrete examples of how the skill will be used. This understanding can come from either direct user examples or generated examples that are validated with user feedback.\n\nFor example, when building an image-editor skill, relevant questions include:\n\n- \"What functionality should the image-editor skill support? Editing, rotating, anything else?\"\n- \"Can you give some examples of how this skill would be used?\"\n- \"I can imagine users asking for things like 'Remove the red-eye from this image' or 'Rotate this image'. Are there other ways you imagine this skill being used?\"\n- \"What would a user say that should trigger this skill?\"\n\nTo avoid overwhelming users, avoid asking too many questions in a single message. Start with the most important questions and follow up as needed for better effectiveness.\n\nConclude this step when there is a clear sense of the functionality the skill should support.\n\n### Step 2: Planning the Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo turn concrete examples into an effective skill, analyze each example by:\n\n1. Considering how to execute on the example from scratch\n2. Identifying what scripts, references, and assets would be helpful when executing these workflows repeatedly\n\nExample: When building a `pdf-editor` skill to handle queries like \"Help me rotate this PDF,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Rotating a PDF requires re-writing the same code each time\n2. A `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` script would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When designing a `frontend-webapp-builder` skill for queries like \"Build me a todo app\" or \"Build me a dashboard to track my steps,\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Writing a frontend webapp requires the same boilerplate HTML/React each time\n2. An `assets/hello-world/` template containing the boilerplate HTML/React project files would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nExample: When building a `big-query` skill to handle queries like \"How many users have logged in today?\" the analysis shows:\n\n1. Querying BigQuery requires re-discovering the table schemas and relationships each time\n2. A `references/schema.md` file documenting the table schemas would be helpful to store in the skill\n\nTo establish the skill's contents, analyze each concrete example to create a list of the reusable resources to include: scripts, references, and assets.\n\n### Step 3: Initializing the Skill\n\nAt this point, it is time to actually create the skill.\n\nSkip this step only if the skill being developed already exists, and iteration or packaging is needed. In this case, continue to the next step.\n\nWhen creating a new skill from scratch, always run the `init_skill.py` script. The script conveniently generates a new template skill directory that automatically includes everything a skill requires, making the skill creation process much more efficient and reliable.\n\nUsage:\n\n```bash\nscripts/init_skill.py <skill-name> --path <output-directory>\n```\n\nThe script:\n\n- Creates the skill directory at the specified path\n- Generates a SKILL.md template with proper frontmatter and TODO placeholders\n- Creates example resource directories: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`\n- Adds example files in each directory that can be customized or deleted\n\nAfter initialization, customize or remove the generated SKILL.md and example files as needed.\n\n### Step 4: Edit the Skill\n\nWhen editing the (newly-generated or existing) skill, remember that the skill is being created for another instance of Claude to use. Focus on including information that would be beneficial and non-obvious to Claude. Consider what procedural knowledge, domain-specific details, or reusable assets would help another Claude instance execute these tasks more effectively.\n\n#### Start with Reusable Skill Contents\n\nTo begin implementation, start with the reusable resources identified above: `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` files. Note that this step may require user input. For example, when implementing a `brand-guidelines` skill, the user may need to provide brand assets or templates to store in `assets/`, or documentation to store in `references/`.\n\nAlso, delete any example files and directories not needed for the skill. The initialization script creates example files in `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/` to demonstrate structure, but most skills won't need all of them.\n\n#### Update SKILL.md\n\n**Writing Style:** Write the entire skill using **imperative/infinitive form** (verb-first instructions), not second person. Use objective, instructional language (e.g., \"To accomplish X, do Y\" rather than \"You should do X\" or \"If you need to do X\"). This maintains consistency and clarity for AI consumption.\n\nTo complete SKILL.md, answer the following questions:\n\n1. What is the purpose of the skill, in a few sentences?\n2. When should the skill be used?\n3. In practice, how should Claude use the skill? All reusable skill contents developed above should be referenced so that Claude knows how to use them.\n\n### Step 5: Packaging a Skill\n\nOnce the skill is ready, it should be packaged into a distributable zip file that gets shared with the user. The packaging process automatically validates the skill first to ensure it meets all requirements:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder>\n```\n\nOptional output directory specification:\n\n```bash\nscripts/package_skill.py <path/to/skill-folder> ./dist\n```\n\nThe packaging script will:\n\n1. **Validate** the skill automatically, checking:\n   - YAML frontmatter format and required fields\n   - Skill naming conventions and directory structure\n   - Description completeness and quality\n   - File organization and resource references\n\n2. **Package** the skill if validation passes, creating a zip file named after the skill (e.g., `my-skill.zip`) that includes all files and maintains the proper directory structure for distribution.\n\nIf validation fails, the script will report the errors and exit without creating a package. Fix any validation errors and run the packaging command again.\n\n### Step 6: Iterate\n\nAfter testing the skill, users may request improvements. Often this happens right after using the skill, with fresh context of how the skill performed.\n\n**Iteration workflow:**\n1. Use the skill on real tasks\n2. Notice struggles or inefficiencies\n3. Identify how SKILL.md or bundled resources should be updated\n4. Implement changes and test again\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"2c0e33ac-b62e-4ee1-8018-153518a99cbf","timestamp":"2025-10-20T01:40:40.669Z"}

This practice complicates debugging, reduces local reasoning, and can lead to violations of the Rules of Hooks. Always call Hooks directly within the component or Hook where their functionality is needed.\n\n```javascript\nfunction ChatInput() {\n  return <Button useData={useDataWithLogging} /> // 🔴 Bad: don't pass Hooks as props\n}\n```\n\n```javascript\nfunction ChatInput() {\n  return <Button />\n}\n\nfunction Button() {\n  const data = useDataWithLogging(); // ✅ Good: Use the Hook directly\n}\n\nfunction useDataWithLogging() {\n  // If there's any conditional logic to change the Hook's behavior, it should be inlined into\n  // the Hook\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Identify invalid React component and hook factories in JavaScript\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/lints/component-hook-factories.md\n\nThis code snippet demonstrates examples of invalid patterns where React components or custom hooks are defined inside other functions, leading to re-creation on every render, state loss, and performance issues. This includes factory functions creating components, components defined within other components, and hook factory functions.\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ Factory function creating components\nfunction createComponent(defaultValue) {\n  return function Component() {\n    // ...\n  };\n}\n\n// ❌ Component defined inside component\nfunction Parent() {\n  function Child() {\n    // ...\n  }\n\n  return <Child />;\n}\n\n// ❌ Hook factory function\nfunction createCustomHook(endpoint) {\n  return function useData() {\n    // ...\n  };\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Consuming React Task Context Hooks in Components\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/scaling-up-with-reducer-and-context.md\n\nIllustrates how to use the `useTasks` and `useTasksDispatch` custom hooks within a React component. This pattern allows components to easily retrieve the current task state and dispatch actions to update it, without directly importing the context objects.\n\n```js\nconst tasks = useTasks();\nconst dispatch = useTasksDispatch();\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Illustrate valid React component and hook definitions in JavaScript\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/lints/component-hook-factories.md\n\nThis code snippet provides examples of correct patterns for defining React components and custom hooks. Both are defined at the module level, ensuring stable identities across renders and preventing unnecessary re-creation or state loss.\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Component defined at module level\nfunction Component({ defaultValue }) {\n  // ...\n}\n\n// ✅ Custom hook at module level\nfunction useData(endpoint) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### React ChatRoom Component Using Custom Hook\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks.md\n\nThis code snippet illustrates how the `ChatRoom` component can be simplified by utilizing the `useChatRoom` custom Hook. Instead of directly implementing `useEffect` for connection management, the component now calls `useChatRoom` with `roomId` and `serverUrl`. This approach significantly reduces the component's internal complexity, making its logic clearer and more focused on rendering UI.\n\n```javascript\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Correct Hook Usage: Top-Level Calls in React Components and Custom Hooks\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/rules/rules-of-hooks.md\n\nThis snippet demonstrates the correct way to call React Hooks, emphasizing that they must be called at the top level of a function component or a custom Hook. It shows examples of `useState` being used correctly within `Counter` (a function component) and `useWindowWidth` (a custom Hook). Adhering to this rule ensures predictable behavior and proper state management.\n\n```js\nfunction Counter() {\n  // ✅ Good: top-level in a function component\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  // ...\n}\n\nfunction useWindowWidth() {\n  // ✅ Good: top-level in a custom Hook\n  const [width, setWidth] = useState(window.innerWidth);\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### React: Basic Form Input Management with useState\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks.md\n\nA React component demonstrating a common pattern for managing multiple form inputs (`firstName`, `lastName`). Each input has its own `useState` hook and a dedicated change handler, leading to repetitive logic that can be abstracted.\n\n```js\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Mary');\n  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Poppins');\n\n  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {\n    setFirstName(e.target.value);\n  }\n\n  function handleLastNameChange(e) {\n    setLastName(e.target.value);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        First name:\n        <input value={firstName} onChange={handleFirstNameChange} />\n      </label>\n      <label>\n        Last name:\n        <input value={lastName} onChange={handleLastNameChange} />\n      </label>\n      <p><b>Good morning, {firstName} {lastName}.</b></p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### React ShippingForm Component Refactored with useData Custom Hook\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks.md\n\nThis version of the `ShippingForm` component demonstrates how to use the `useData` custom hook to simplify its data fetching logic. By replacing repetitive `useEffect` calls with the custom hook, the component becomes more concise and easier to read.\n\n```js\nfunction ShippingForm({ country }) {\n  const cities = useData(`/api/cities?country=${country}`);\n  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);\n  const areas = useData(city ? `/api/areas?city=${city}` : null);\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Using React Hooks: Avoid Dynamic Mutation and Higher-Order Hooks in JavaScript\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/rules/react-calls-components-and-hooks.md\n\nReact Hooks should be static and immutable. Avoid creating higher-order Hooks or dynamically mutating them, as this can hinder local reasoning and prevent automatic optimizations. Instead, inline the desired logic into a new, static Hook.\n\n```javascript\nfunction ChatInput() {\n  const useDataWithLogging = withLogging(useData); // 🔴 Bad: don't write higher order Hooks\n  const data = useDataWithLogging();\n}\n```\n\n```javascript\nfunction ChatInput() {\n  const data = useDataWithLogging(); // ✅ Good: Create a new version of the Hook\n}\n\nfunction useDataWithLogging() {\n  // ... Create a new version of the Hook and inline the logic here\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### React: Refactoring Form Input with a Custom Hook\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks.md\n\nRefactors the `Form` component to use the `useFormInput` custom hook for managing input fields. This approach encapsulates the state and change handler logic, resulting in cleaner component code and promoting reusable stateful logic for each input.\n\n```js\nimport { useFormInput } from './useFormInput.js';\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const firstNameProps = useFormInput('Mary');\n  const lastNameProps = useFormInput('Poppins');\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        First name:\n        <input {...firstNameProps} />\n      </label>\n      <label>\n        Last name:\n        <input {...lastNameProps} />\n      </label>\n      <p><b>Good morning, {firstNameProps.value} {lastNameProps.value}.</b></p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Correct Hook Usage: Calling Hooks from React Functions Only\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/rules/rules-of-hooks.md\n\nThis snippet demonstrates the rule that Hooks should only be called from React function components or custom Hooks, not from regular JavaScript functions. It shows a correct usage within `FriendList` (a function component) and an incorrect usage where `useOnlineStatus` is called from a plain JavaScript function `setOnlineStatus`. This rule ensures that stateful logic is clearly visible and managed within the React component lifecycle.\n\n```js\nfunction FriendList() {\n  const [onlineStatus, setOnlineStatus] = useOnlineStatus(); // ✅\n}\n\nfunction setOnlineStatus() { // ❌ Not a component or custom Hook!\n  const [onlineStatus, setOnlineStatus] = useOnlineStatus();\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### React Components Using Hypothetical useOnlineStatus Hook\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks.md\n\nDemonstrates how two React components, `StatusBar` and `SaveButton`, would look if a `useOnlineStatus` hook were available. This highlights the duplicated online status logic that can be abstracted into a custom hook.\n\n```js\nfunction StatusBar() {\n  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();\n  return <h1>{isOnline ? '✅ Online' : '❌ Disconnected'}</h1>;\n}\n\nfunction SaveButton() {\n  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();\n\n  function handleSaveClick() {\n    console.log('✅ Progress saved');\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <button disabled={!isOnline} onClick={handleSaveClick}>\n      {isOnline ? 'Save progress' : 'Reconnecting...'}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Declare React State Variable using useState Hook\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/rules/components-and-hooks-must-be-pure.md\n\nDemonstrates the basic syntax for declaring a state variable and its corresponding setter function using the `useState` hook in React. This pattern is fundamental for managing local component state.\n\n```js\nconst [stateVariable, setter] = useState(0);\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Incorrect useFormStatus Usage: Hook in Same Component as Form\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/react-dom/hooks/useFormStatus.md\n\nIllustrates an incorrect usage pattern where `useFormStatus` is called in the same component that renders the `<form>`. This will prevent the `pending` state from updating correctly, as the hook only tracks parent forms.\n\n```javascript\nfunction Form() {\n  // 🚩 `pending` will never be true\n  // useFormStatus does not track the form rendered in this component\n  const { pending } = useFormStatus();\n  return <form action={submit}></form>;\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Correct Usage of React Hooks in Function Components and Custom Hooks\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/warnings/invalid-hook-call-warning.md\n\nThis example demonstrates the correct placement for calling React Hooks, such as `useState`. Hooks must be called at the top level of a function component or a custom Hook, ensuring they are not nested within conditions, loops, or other functions.\n\n```javascript\nfunction Counter() {\n  // ✅ Good: top-level in a function component\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  // ...\n}\n\nfunction useWindowWidth() {\n  // ✅ Good: top-level in a custom Hook\n  const [width, setWidth] = useState(window.innerWidth);\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### React `use` API for Chained Data Fetching\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks.md\n\nThis example illustrates a potential future pattern for data fetching within a React functional component using the `use` hook. It shows how to perform chained data fetches, where the result of one `fetch` call (`cities`) is used to inform a subsequent `fetch` call (`areas`), demonstrating a declarative approach to asynchronous operations.\n\n```js\nimport { use } from 'react';\n\nfunction ShippingForm({ country }) {\n  const cities = use(fetch(`/api/cities?country=${country}`));\n  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);\n  const areas = city ? use(fetch(`/api/areas?city=${city}`)) : null;\n  // ...\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Avoid Custom 'Lifecycle' Hooks (e.g., useMount) in React Components\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks.md\n\nIllustrates an anti-pattern: using a custom `useMount` hook that wraps `useEffect`. This approach leads to issues like overlooked dependencies and bypasses React linter checks, making debugging harder. It discourages custom Hooks that merely abstract `useEffect` lifecycle.\n\n```js\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n  // 🔴 Avoid: using custom \"lifecycle\" Hooks\n  useMount(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection({ roomId, serverUrl });\n    connection.connect();\n\n    post('/analytics/event', { eventName: 'visit_chat' });\n  });\n  // ...\n}\n\n// 🔴 Avoid: creating custom \"lifecycle\" Hooks\nfunction useMount(fn) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    fn();\n  }, []); // 🔴 React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'fn'\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### React ShippingForm Component with Separate Data Fetching Effects\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks.md\n\nThis React component demonstrates fetching data for cities and areas using two separate `useEffect` hooks. Each effect manages its own state and side effects, leading to some code duplication for similar data fetching patterns.\n\n```js\nfunction ShippingForm({ country }) {\n  const [cities, setCities] = useState(null);\n  // This Effect fetches cities for a country\n  useEffect(() => {\n    let ignore = false;\n    fetch(`/api/cities?country=${country}`)\n      .then(response => response.json())\n      .then(json => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setCities(json);\n        }\n      });\n    return () => {\n      ignore = true;\n    };\n  }, [country]);\n\n  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);\n  const [areas, setAreas] = useState(null);\n  // This Effect fetches areas for the selected city\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (city) {\n      let ignore = false;\n      fetch(`/api/areas?city=${city}`)\n        .then(response => response.json())\n        .then(json => {\n          if (!ignore) {\n            setAreas(json);\n          }\n        });\n      return () => {\n        ignore = true;\n      };\n    }\n  }, [city]);\n\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Optimizing Custom React Hook Returned Functions with useCallback\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/react/useCallback.md\n\nWhen creating custom React Hooks, it's good practice to wrap any functions returned by the hook (e.g., `navigate`, `goBack`) with `useCallback`. This optimization ensures that consumers of the hook receive stable function references, allowing them to effectively memoize or optimize their own components that use these functions.\n\n```javascript\nfunction useRouter() {\n  const { dispatch } = useContext(RouterStateContext);\n\n  const navigate = useCallback((url) => {\n    dispatch({ type: 'navigate', url });\n  }, [dispatch]);\n\n  const goBack = useCallback(() => {\n    dispatch({ type: 'back' });\n  }, [dispatch]);\n\n  return {\n    navigate,\n    goBack,\n  };\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Identify Invalid React Hook Usages (JavaScript)\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/lints/rules-of-hooks.md\n\nIllustrates common violations of the Rules of Hooks that can lead to bugs like state mismatches. These patterns include calling hooks conditionally, after early returns, within callbacks or event handlers, wrapping the `use` hook in `try/catch`, or defining hooks at the module level.\n\n```js\n// ❌ Hook in condition\nif (isLoggedIn) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n}\n\n// ❌ Hook after early return\nif (!data) return <Loading />;\nconst [processed, setProcessed] = useState(data);\n\n// ❌ Hook in callback\n<button onClick={() => {\n  const [clicked, setClicked] = useState(false);\n}}/>\n\n// ❌ `use` in try/catch\ntry {\n  const data = use(promise);\n} catch (e) {\n  // error handling\n}\n\n// ❌ Hook at module level\nconst globalState = useState(0); // Outside component\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Implement Valid React Hook Usages (JavaScript)\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/lints/rules-of-hooks.md\n\nProvides examples of correct React hook usage that adhere to the Rules of Hooks. This includes calling hooks unconditionally at the top level of a function component and demonstrating the valid conditional use of the `use` hook.\n\n```js\nfunction Component({ isSpecial, shouldFetch, fetchPromise }) {\n  // ✅ Hooks at top level\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  const [name, setName] = useState('');\n\n  if (!isSpecial) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  if (shouldFetch) {\n    // ✅ `use` can be conditional\n    const data = use(fetchPromise);\n    return <div>{data}</div>;\n  }\n\n  return <div>{name}: {count}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Avoid Mutating Hook Arguments Directly (Bad Example)\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/rules/components-and-hooks-must-be-pure.md\n\nDemonstrates an incorrect practice of directly modifying an object passed as an argument to a custom React Hook. Mutating hook arguments can lead to unpredictable behavior and break memoization optimizations within the hook, violating the immutability principle.\n\n```js\nfunction useIconStyle(icon) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  if (icon.enabled) {\n    icon.className = computeStyle(icon, theme); // Ⓣ Bad: never mutate hook arguments directly\n  }\n  return icon;\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Consuming React Context with useContext Hook\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/scaling-up-with-reducer-and-context.md\n\nThis example shows how a functional component, `TaskList`, directly accesses the `tasks` array from `TasksContext` using the `useContext` hook. This pattern allows components to retrieve necessary data from the context without receiving it as props from their parents.\n\n```javascript\nexport default function TaskList() {\n  const tasks = useContext(TasksContext);\n  // ...\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### React `ChatRoom` Component Passing `onReceiveMessage` Prop\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks.md\n\nThis React component demonstrates how to pass a custom `onReceiveMessage` event handler as a prop to the `useChatRoom` hook. This approach allows the component to define what action to take when a new message is received from the chat, making the hook more flexible.\n\n```js\nexport default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n  useChatRoom({\n    roomId: roomId,\n    serverUrl: serverUrl,\n    onReceiveMessage(msg) {\n      showNotification('New message: ' + msg);\n    }\n  });\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Correcting `use` Hook Placement in React Components\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/react/use.md\n\nThis snippet illustrates the incorrect and correct ways to use the `use` hook in React. The first example shows an anti-pattern where `use` is called within a nested function closure, which is not a React Component or Hook. The second example demonstrates the proper usage, calling `use` directly within the functional component, adhering to React's rules for hooks.\n\n```jsx\nfunction MessageComponent({messagePromise}) {\n  function download() {\n    // ❌ the function calling `use` is not a Component or Hook\n    const message = use(messagePromise);\n    // ...\n\n```\n\n```jsx\nfunction MessageComponent({messagePromise}) {\n  // ✅ `use` is being called from a component. \n  const message = use(messagePromise);\n  // ...\n\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Implement useCounter Custom Hook and Refactor Counter Component (React)\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks.md\n\nThis solution extracts the counter logic into a `useCounter` custom Hook, making the `Counter` component cleaner and reusable. The `useCounter` Hook encapsulates the `useState` and `useEffect` logic, returning the current count.\n\n```javascript\nimport { useCounter } from './useCounter.js';\n\nexport default function Counter() {\n  const count = useCounter();\n  return <h1>Seconds passed: {count}</h1>;\n}\n```\n\n```javascript\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nexport function useCounter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const id = setInterval(() => {\n      setCount(c => c + 1);\n    }, 1000);\n    return () => clearInterval(id);\n  }, []);\n  return count;\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Implement dynamic React components by passing JSX as children in JavaScript\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/lints/component-hook-factories.md\n\nThis code snippet demonstrates the correct way to achieve dynamic component behavior in React by passing JSX as children. This approach avoids factory functions, ensuring component stability, preserving state, and maintaining good performance. It's the recommended pattern for flexible component rendering.\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Better: Pass JSX as children\nfunction Button({color, children}) {\n  return (\n    <button style={{backgroundColor: color}}>\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Button color=\"red\">Red</Button>\n      <Button color=\"blue\">Blue</Button>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Integrate `useList` custom Hook into a React component\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/react/cloneElement.md\n\nThis `App` component demonstrates how to consume the `useList` custom Hook. It destructures `selected` and `onNext` from the hook, rendering a list of products and a button to navigate through them, highlighting the currently selected item based on the hook's state.\n\n```javascript\nexport default function App() {\n  const [selected, onNext] = useList(products);\n  return (\n    <div className=\"List\">\n      {products.map(product =>\n        <Row\n          key={product.id}\n          title={product.title}\n          isHighlighted={selected === product}\n        />\n      )}\n      <hr />\n      <button onClick={onNext}>\n        Next\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Separating Concerns with Multiple React `useEffect` Hooks\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects.md\n\nThis example illustrates the best practice of using multiple `useEffect` hooks to manage distinct synchronization processes. One effect handles analytics logging (`logVisit`) when `roomId` changes, while another independently manages the chat room connection. This separation prevents unintended side effects and improves maintainability.\n\n```js\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    logVisit(roomId);\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n    // ...\n  }, [roomId]);\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Render React Component with Custom useFadeIn Hook\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks.md\n\nThis React JavaScript code defines an `App` component that controls the visibility of a `Welcome` component using `useState`. The `Welcome` component then utilizes a custom `useFadeIn` hook with `useRef` to apply a fade-in animation to an `h1` element when rendered, demonstrating imperative animation logic encapsulated in a hook.\n\n```js\nimport { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';\nimport { useFadeIn } from './useFadeIn.js';\n\nfunction Welcome() {\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n\n  useFadeIn(ref, 1000);\n\n  return (\n    <h1 className=\"welcome\" ref={ref}>\n      Welcome\n    </h1>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>\n        {show ? 'Remove' : 'Show'}\n      </button>\n      <hr />\n      {show && <Welcome />}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### React useData Custom Hook for Centralized Data Fetching\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks.md\n\nThis custom React hook encapsulates the common data fetching logic from the `ShippingForm` component. It takes a URL as input and returns the fetched data, abstracting `useState` and `useEffect` to provide a cleaner API for components.\n\n```js\nfunction useData(url) {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (url) {\n      let ignore = false;\n      fetch(url)\n        .then(response => response.json())\n        .then(json => {\n          if (!ignore) {\n            setData(json);\n          }\n        });\n      return () => {\n        ignore = true;\n      };\n    }\n  }, [url]);\n  return data;\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Avoid Mutating Hook Arguments After Passing to Hook (Bad Example)\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/rules/components-and-hooks-must-be-pure.md\n\nDemonstrates the issue of mutating a variable (`icon`) *after* it has been passed as an argument to a hook (`useIconStyle`). If the hook's return value is memoized based on the original `icon` reference, subsequent mutations to `icon` outside the hook will not trigger re-computation, leading to stale results. This highlights the importance of treating hook arguments as immutable.\n\n```js\nstyle = useIconStyle(icon);         // `style` is memoized based on `icon`\nicon.enabled = false;               // Bad: Ⓣ never mutate hook arguments directly\nstyle = useIconStyle(icon);         // previously memoized result is returned\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Avoid Mutating Values After Being Passed to JSX (Bad Example)\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/rules/components-and-hooks-must-be-pure.md\n\nIllustrates an incorrect practice where an object (`styles`) is mutated *after* it has already been passed as a prop to a JSX element (`<Header styles={styles} />`). React might eagerly evaluate JSX, meaning the `Header` component will receive the original `styles` object. Subsequent mutation of `styles` will not update the `Header`, leading to an outdated UI and breaking local reasoning.\n\n```js\nfunction Page({ colour }) {\n  const styles = { colour, size: \"large\" };\n  const header = <Header styles={styles} />;\n  styles.size = \"small\"; // Ⓣ Bad: styles was already used in the JSX above\n  const footer = <Footer styles={styles} />;\n  return (\n    <>\n      {header}\n      <Content />\n      {footer}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Correctly Handle Hook Arguments by Copying (Good Example)\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/rules/components-and-hooks-must-be-pure.md\n\nIllustrates the correct approach to modify an object received as a hook argument. Instead of direct mutation, a new copy of the object (`newIcon`) is created, and modifications are applied to the copy. This preserves immutability and ensures predictable hook behavior, especially with memoization.\n\n```js\nfunction useIconStyle(icon) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  const newIcon = { ...icon }; // ✅ Good: make a copy instead\n  if (newIcon.enabled) {\n    newIcon.className = computeStyle(newIcon, theme);\n  }\n  return newIcon;\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Define React ChatRoom Component with useChatRoom Hook\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks.md\n\nThis React functional component displays a chat room interface, manages its local 'serverUrl' state, and integrates a custom 'useChatRoom' hook to handle connection logic based on the provided 'roomId' and current 'serverUrl'. It sets up the UI for users to view the room and adjust the server.\n\n```javascript\nexport default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n  useChatRoom({\n    roomId: roomId,\n    serverUrl: serverUrl\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Server URL:\n        <input value={serverUrl} onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Client-side Data Fetching in React with Effects and API\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/rsc/server-components.md\n\nDemonstrates a common pattern for fetching dynamic data in React applications using `useState` and `useEffect` hooks on the client-side. It also includes corresponding server-side API endpoints that serve the data. This approach often leads to client-server waterfalls due to sequential client-side fetches.\n\n```js\n// bundle.js\nfunction Note({id}) {\n  const [note, setNote] = useState('');\n  // NOTE: loads *after* first render.\n  useEffect(() => {\n    fetch(`/api/notes/${id}`).then(data => {\n      setNote(data.note);\n    });\n  }, [id]);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Author id={note.authorId} />\n      <p>{note}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Author({id}) {\n  const [author, setAuthor] = useState('');\n  // NOTE: loads *after* Note renders.\n  // Causing an expensive client-server waterfall.\n  useEffect(() => {\n    fetch(`/api/authors/${id}`).then(data => {\n      setAuthor(data.author);\n    });\n  }, [id]);\n\n  return <span>By: {author.name}</span>;\n}\n```\n\n```js\n// api\nimport db from './database';\n\napp.get(`/api/notes/:id`, async (req, res) => {\n  const note = await db.notes.get(id);\n  res.send({note});\n});\n\napp.get(`/api/authors/:id`, async (req, res) => {\n  const author = await db.authors.get(id);\n  res.send({author});\n});\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Encapsulate Online Status Logic in a Custom React Hook\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/react/useSyncExternalStore.md\n\nDemonstrates how to create a reusable custom React hook, `useOnlineStatus`, that leverages `useSyncExternalStore` to track the browser's network status. This hook abstracts away the subscription and snapshot logic, making it easy for multiple components to consume the online status. The example includes an `App` component with `StatusBar` and `SaveButton` components that both utilize the `useOnlineStatus` hook.\n\n```js\nimport { useOnlineStatus } from './useOnlineStatus.js';\n\nfunction StatusBar() {\n  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();\n  return <h1>{isOnline ? '✅ Online' : '❌ Disconnected'}</h1>;\n}\n\nfunction SaveButton() {\n  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();\n\n  function handleSaveClick() {\n    console.log('✅ Progress saved');\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <button disabled={!isOnline} onClick={handleSaveClick}>\n      {isOnline ? 'Save progress' : 'Reconnecting...'}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <SaveButton />\n      <StatusBar />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n```js\nimport { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';\n\nexport function useOnlineStatus() {\n  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);\n  return isOnline;\n}\n\nfunction getSnapshot() {\n  return navigator.onLine;\n}\n\nfunction subscribe(callback) {\n  window.addEventListener('online', callback);\n  window.addEventListener('offline', callback);\n  return () => {\n    window.removeEventListener('online', callback);\n    window.removeEventListener('offline', callback);\n  };\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### React Custom Hooks for Task Context Access\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/scaling-up-with-reducer-and-context.md\n\nDefines `useTasks` and `useTasksDispatch` custom hooks. These hooks encapsulate the `useContext` calls, providing a cleaner and more maintainable way for components to access the task state and dispatch function from the `TasksContext`.\n\n```js\nexport function useTasks() {\n  return useContext(TasksContext);\n}\n\nexport function useTasksDispatch() {\n  return useContext(TasksDispatchContext);\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### React App Component for Chat Room Selection\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks.md\n\nThis React functional component, `App`, serves as the main application entry point. It manages the `roomId` state using the `useState` hook and provides a dropdown (`select` element) for users to choose different chat rooms. The selected `roomId` is then passed as a prop to the `ChatRoom` component, illustrating how reactive values are managed and passed down the component tree.\n\n```javascript\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport ChatRoom from './ChatRoom.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Choose the chat room:{' '}\n        <select\n          value={roomId}\n          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}\n        >\n          <option value=\"general\">general</option>\n          <option value=\"travel\">travel</option>\n          <option value=\"music\">music</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <hr />\n      <ChatRoom\n        roomId={roomId}\n      />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Memoize Hook Return Values Based on Immutable Arguments\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/rules/components-and-hooks-must-be-pure.md\n\nShows how `useMemo` can be used within a custom hook to optimize performance by memoizing computed values. The `newIcon` object is created and modified within the `useMemo` callback, ensuring that the computation is re-run only when the `icon` or `theme` dependencies change. This approach relies on the immutability of `icon` and `theme`.\n\n```js\nfunction useIconStyle(icon) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n\n  return useMemo(() => {\n    const newIcon = { ...icon };\n    if (newIcon.enabled) {\n      newIcon.className = computeStyle(newIcon, theme);\n    }\n    return newIcon;\n  }, [icon, theme]);\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Using useContext for Global State in React\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/react/hooks.md\n\nIllustrates how to consume a React Context using the `useContext` Hook. This allows components to access information from distant parent components without prop drilling, useful for themes or user settings.\n\n```javascript\nfunction Button() {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  // ...\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Calling React Components: Avoid Direct Function Calls in JavaScript\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/rules/react-calls-components-and-hooks.md\n\nReact components should only be invoked through JSX, allowing React to manage their lifecycle and state. Direct function calls to components can violate the Rules of Hooks and prevent React from optimizing rendering, debugging, and reconciliation processes.\n\n```javascript\nfunction BlogPost() {\n  return <Layout><Article /></Layout>; // ✅ Good: Only use components in JSX\n}\n```\n\n```javascript\nfunction BlogPost() {\n  return <Layout>{Article()}</Layout>; // 🔴 Bad: Never call them directly\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Correct React Hook Placement (Solution 1)\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/state-a-components-memory.md\n\nThis solution fixes the conditional hook call issue by moving the `useState` hook for `message` outside the `if/else` block. This ensures that all hooks are called unconditionally at the top level of the component function, adhering to React's Rules of Hooks and preventing crashes.\n\n```js\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function FeedbackForm() {\n  const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false);\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n  if (isSent) {\n    return <h1>Thank you!</h1>;\n  } else {\n    return (\n      <form onSubmit={e => {\n        e.preventDefault();\n        alert(`Sending: \"${message}\"`);\n        setIsSent(true);\n      }}>\n        <textarea\n          placeholder=\"Message\"\n          value={message}\n          onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)}\n        />\n        <br />\n        <button type=\"submit\">Send</button>\n      </form>\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Correct useFormStatus Usage: Hook in Child Component of Form\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/react-dom/hooks/useFormStatus.md\n\nDemonstrates the correct usage of `useFormStatus` by calling it from a component (`Submit`) that is rendered as a child *inside* the `<form>`. This ensures the hook correctly tracks the parent form's submission status.\n\n```javascript\nfunction Submit() {\n  // ✅ `pending` will be derived from the form that wraps the Submit component\n  const { pending } = useFormStatus(); \n  return <button disabled={pending}>...</button>;\n}\n\nfunction Form() {\n  // This is the <form> `useFormStatus` tracks\n  return (\n    <form action={submit}>\n      <Submit />\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Correctly Handle JSX Props by Creating New Objects (Good Example)\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/rules/components-and-hooks-must-be-pure.md\n\nDemonstrates the correct way to provide different prop values to JSX elements. Instead of mutating an existing object, a new object (`footerStyles`) is created with the desired values for the `Footer` component. This ensures that each component receives its own distinct set of props, maintaining immutability and predictable rendering behavior in React.\n\n```js\nfunction Page({ colour }) {\n  const headerStyles = { colour, size: \"large\" };\n  const header = <Header styles={headerStyles} />;\n  const footerStyles = { colour, size: \"small\" }; // ✅ Good: we created a new value\n  const footer = <Footer styles={footerStyles} />;\n  return (\n    <>\n      {header}\n      <Content />\n      {footer}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```"}]}]},"uuid":"360e4888-1018-4647-bdea-1da8c26ddf9c","timestamp":"2025-10-20T01:40:46.432Z","toolUseResult":[{"type":"text","text":"### Passing React Hooks: Avoid Dynamic Usage and Prop Passing in JavaScript\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/rules/react-calls-components-and-hooks.md\n\nHooks should not be passed around dynamically, for example, as props to components. This practice complicates debugging, reduces local reasoning, and can lead to violations of the Rules of Hooks. Always call Hooks directly within the component or Hook where their functionality is needed.\n\n```javascript\nfunction ChatInput() {\n  return <Button useData={useDataWithLogging} /> // 🔴 Bad: don't pass Hooks as props\n}\n```\n\n```javascript\nfunction ChatInput() {\n  return <Button />\n}\n\nfunction Button() {\n  const data = useDataWithLogging(); // ✅ Good: Use the Hook directly\n}\n\nfunction useDataWithLogging() {\n  // If there's any conditional logic to change the Hook's behavior, it should be inlined into\n  // the Hook\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Identify invalid React component and hook factories in JavaScript\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/lints/component-hook-factories.md\n\nThis code snippet demonstrates examples of invalid patterns where React components or custom hooks are defined inside other functions, leading to re-creation on every render, state loss, and performance issues. This includes factory functions creating components, components defined within other components, and hook factory functions.\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ Factory function creating components\nfunction createComponent(defaultValue) {\n  return function Component() {\n    // ...\n  };\n}\n\n// ❌ Component defined inside component\nfunction Parent() {\n  function Child() {\n    // ...\n  }\n\n  return <Child />;\n}\n\n// ❌ Hook factory function\nfunction createCustomHook(endpoint) {\n  return function useData() {\n    // ...\n  };\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Consuming React Task Context Hooks in Components\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/scaling-up-with-reducer-and-context.md\n\nIllustrates how to use the `useTasks` and `useTasksDispatch` custom hooks within a React component. This pattern allows components to easily retrieve the current task state and dispatch actions to update it, without directly importing the context objects.\n\n```js\nconst tasks = useTasks();\nconst dispatch = useTasksDispatch();\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Illustrate valid React component and hook definitions in JavaScript\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/lints/component-hook-factories.md\n\nThis code snippet provides examples of correct patterns for defining React components and custom hooks. Both are defined at the module level, ensuring stable identities across renders and preventing unnecessary re-creation or state loss.\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Component defined at module level\nfunction Component({ defaultValue }) {\n  // ...\n}\n\n// ✅ Custom hook at module level\nfunction useData(endpoint) {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### React ChatRoom Component Using Custom Hook\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks.md\n\nThis code snippet illustrates how the `ChatRoom` component can be simplified by utilizing the `useChatRoom` custom Hook. Instead of directly implementing `useEffect` for connection management, the component now calls `useChatRoom` with `roomId` and `serverUrl`. This approach significantly reduces the component's internal complexity, making its logic clearer and more focused on rendering UI.\n\n```javascript\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Correct Hook Usage: Top-Level Calls in React Components and Custom Hooks\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/rules/rules-of-hooks.md\n\nThis snippet demonstrates the correct way to call React Hooks, emphasizing that they must be called at the top level of a function component or a custom Hook. It shows examples of `useState` being used correctly within `Counter` (a function component) and `useWindowWidth` (a custom Hook). Adhering to this rule ensures predictable behavior and proper state management.\n\n```js\nfunction Counter() {\n  // ✅ Good: top-level in a function component\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  // ...\n}\n\nfunction useWindowWidth() {\n  // ✅ Good: top-level in a custom Hook\n  const [width, setWidth] = useState(window.innerWidth);\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### React: Basic Form Input Management with useState\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks.md\n\nA React component demonstrating a common pattern for managing multiple form inputs (`firstName`, `lastName`). Each input has its own `useState` hook and a dedicated change handler, leading to repetitive logic that can be abstracted.\n\n```js\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Mary');\n  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Poppins');\n\n  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {\n    setFirstName(e.target.value);\n  }\n\n  function handleLastNameChange(e) {\n    setLastName(e.target.value);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        First name:\n        <input value={firstName} onChange={handleFirstNameChange} />\n      </label>\n      <label>\n        Last name:\n        <input value={lastName} onChange={handleLastNameChange} />\n      </label>\n      <p><b>Good morning, {firstName} {lastName}.</b></p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### React ShippingForm Component Refactored with useData Custom Hook\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks.md\n\nThis version of the `ShippingForm` component demonstrates how to use the `useData` custom hook to simplify its data fetching logic. By replacing repetitive `useEffect` calls with the custom hook, the component becomes more concise and easier to read.\n\n```js\nfunction ShippingForm({ country }) {\n  const cities = useData(`/api/cities?country=${country}`);\n  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);\n  const areas = useData(city ? `/api/areas?city=${city}` : null);\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Using React Hooks: Avoid Dynamic Mutation and Higher-Order Hooks in JavaScript\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/rules/react-calls-components-and-hooks.md\n\nReact Hooks should be static and immutable. Avoid creating higher-order Hooks or dynamically mutating them, as this can hinder local reasoning and prevent automatic optimizations. Instead, inline the desired logic into a new, static Hook.\n\n```javascript\nfunction ChatInput() {\n  const useDataWithLogging = withLogging(useData); // 🔴 Bad: don't write higher order Hooks\n  const data = useDataWithLogging();\n}\n```\n\n```javascript\nfunction ChatInput() {\n  const data = useDataWithLogging(); // ✅ Good: Create a new version of the Hook\n}\n\nfunction useDataWithLogging() {\n  // ... Create a new version of the Hook and inline the logic here\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### React: Refactoring Form Input with a Custom Hook\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks.md\n\nRefactors the `Form` component to use the `useFormInput` custom hook for managing input fields. This approach encapsulates the state and change handler logic, resulting in cleaner component code and promoting reusable stateful logic for each input.\n\n```js\nimport { useFormInput } from './useFormInput.js';\n\nexport default function Form() {\n  const firstNameProps = useFormInput('Mary');\n  const lastNameProps = useFormInput('Poppins');\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        First name:\n        <input {...firstNameProps} />\n      </label>\n      <label>\n        Last name:\n        <input {...lastNameProps} />\n      </label>\n      <p><b>Good morning, {firstNameProps.value} {lastNameProps.value}.</b></p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Correct Hook Usage: Calling Hooks from React Functions Only\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/rules/rules-of-hooks.md\n\nThis snippet demonstrates the rule that Hooks should only be called from React function components or custom Hooks, not from regular JavaScript functions. It shows a correct usage within `FriendList` (a function component) and an incorrect usage where `useOnlineStatus` is called from a plain JavaScript function `setOnlineStatus`. This rule ensures that stateful logic is clearly visible and managed within the React component lifecycle.\n\n```js\nfunction FriendList() {\n  const [onlineStatus, setOnlineStatus] = useOnlineStatus(); // ✅\n}\n\nfunction setOnlineStatus() { // ❌ Not a component or custom Hook!\n  const [onlineStatus, setOnlineStatus] = useOnlineStatus();\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### React Components Using Hypothetical useOnlineStatus Hook\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks.md\n\nDemonstrates how two React components, `StatusBar` and `SaveButton`, would look if a `useOnlineStatus` hook were available. This highlights the duplicated online status logic that can be abstracted into a custom hook.\n\n```js\nfunction StatusBar() {\n  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();\n  return <h1>{isOnline ? '✅ Online' : '❌ Disconnected'}</h1>;\n}\n\nfunction SaveButton() {\n  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();\n\n  function handleSaveClick() {\n    console.log('✅ Progress saved');\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <button disabled={!isOnline} onClick={handleSaveClick}>\n      {isOnline ? 'Save progress' : 'Reconnecting...'}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Declare React State Variable using useState Hook\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/rules/components-and-hooks-must-be-pure.md\n\nDemonstrates the basic syntax for declaring a state variable and its corresponding setter function using the `useState` hook in React. This pattern is fundamental for managing local component state.\n\n```js\nconst [stateVariable, setter] = useState(0);\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Incorrect useFormStatus Usage: Hook in Same Component as Form\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/react-dom/hooks/useFormStatus.md\n\nIllustrates an incorrect usage pattern where `useFormStatus` is called in the same component that renders the `<form>`. This will prevent the `pending` state from updating correctly, as the hook only tracks parent forms.\n\n```javascript\nfunction Form() {\n  // 🚩 `pending` will never be true\n  // useFormStatus does not track the form rendered in this component\n  const { pending } = useFormStatus();\n  return <form action={submit}></form>;\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Correct Usage of React Hooks in Function Components and Custom Hooks\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/warnings/invalid-hook-call-warning.md\n\nThis example demonstrates the correct placement for calling React Hooks, such as `useState`. Hooks must be called at the top level of a function component or a custom Hook, ensuring they are not nested within conditions, loops, or other functions.\n\n```javascript\nfunction Counter() {\n  // ✅ Good: top-level in a function component\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  // ...\n}\n\nfunction useWindowWidth() {\n  // ✅ Good: top-level in a custom Hook\n  const [width, setWidth] = useState(window.innerWidth);\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### React `use` API for Chained Data Fetching\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks.md\n\nThis example illustrates a potential future pattern for data fetching within a React functional component using the `use` hook. It shows how to perform chained data fetches, where the result of one `fetch` call (`cities`) is used to inform a subsequent `fetch` call (`areas`), demonstrating a declarative approach to asynchronous operations.\n\n```js\nimport { use } from 'react';\n\nfunction ShippingForm({ country }) {\n  const cities = use(fetch(`/api/cities?country=${country}`));\n  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);\n  const areas = city ? use(fetch(`/api/areas?city=${city}`)) : null;\n  // ...\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Avoid Custom 'Lifecycle' Hooks (e.g., useMount) in React Components\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks.md\n\nIllustrates an anti-pattern: using a custom `useMount` hook that wraps `useEffect`. This approach leads to issues like overlooked dependencies and bypasses React linter checks, making debugging harder. It discourages custom Hooks that merely abstract `useEffect` lifecycle.\n\n```js\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n  // 🔴 Avoid: using custom \"lifecycle\" Hooks\n  useMount(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection({ roomId, serverUrl });\n    connection.connect();\n\n    post('/analytics/event', { eventName: 'visit_chat' });\n  });\n  // ...\n}\n\n// 🔴 Avoid: creating custom \"lifecycle\" Hooks\nfunction useMount(fn) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    fn();\n  }, []); // 🔴 React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'fn'\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### React ShippingForm Component with Separate Data Fetching Effects\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks.md\n\nThis React component demonstrates fetching data for cities and areas using two separate `useEffect` hooks. Each effect manages its own state and side effects, leading to some code duplication for similar data fetching patterns.\n\n```js\nfunction ShippingForm({ country }) {\n  const [cities, setCities] = useState(null);\n  // This Effect fetches cities for a country\n  useEffect(() => {\n    let ignore = false;\n    fetch(`/api/cities?country=${country}`)\n      .then(response => response.json())\n      .then(json => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setCities(json);\n        }\n      });\n    return () => {\n      ignore = true;\n    };\n  }, [country]);\n\n  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);\n  const [areas, setAreas] = useState(null);\n  // This Effect fetches areas for the selected city\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (city) {\n      let ignore = false;\n      fetch(`/api/areas?city=${city}`)\n        .then(response => response.json())\n        .then(json => {\n          if (!ignore) {\n            setAreas(json);\n          }\n        });\n      return () => {\n        ignore = true;\n      };\n    }\n  }, [city]);\n\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Optimizing Custom React Hook Returned Functions with useCallback\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/react/useCallback.md\n\nWhen creating custom React Hooks, it's good practice to wrap any functions returned by the hook (e.g., `navigate`, `goBack`) with `useCallback`. This optimization ensures that consumers of the hook receive stable function references, allowing them to effectively memoize or optimize their own components that use these functions.\n\n```javascript\nfunction useRouter() {\n  const { dispatch } = useContext(RouterStateContext);\n\n  const navigate = useCallback((url) => {\n    dispatch({ type: 'navigate', url });\n  }, [dispatch]);\n\n  const goBack = useCallback(() => {\n    dispatch({ type: 'back' });\n  }, [dispatch]);\n\n  return {\n    navigate,\n    goBack,\n  };\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Identify Invalid React Hook Usages (JavaScript)\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/lints/rules-of-hooks.md\n\nIllustrates common violations of the Rules of Hooks that can lead to bugs like state mismatches. These patterns include calling hooks conditionally, after early returns, within callbacks or event handlers, wrapping the `use` hook in `try/catch`, or defining hooks at the module level.\n\n```js\n// ❌ Hook in condition\nif (isLoggedIn) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n}\n\n// ❌ Hook after early return\nif (!data) return <Loading />;\nconst [processed, setProcessed] = useState(data);\n\n// ❌ Hook in callback\n<button onClick={() => {\n  const [clicked, setClicked] = useState(false);\n}}/>\n\n// ❌ `use` in try/catch\ntry {\n  const data = use(promise);\n} catch (e) {\n  // error handling\n}\n\n// ❌ Hook at module level\nconst globalState = useState(0); // Outside component\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Implement Valid React Hook Usages (JavaScript)\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/lints/rules-of-hooks.md\n\nProvides examples of correct React hook usage that adhere to the Rules of Hooks. This includes calling hooks unconditionally at the top level of a function component and demonstrating the valid conditional use of the `use` hook.\n\n```js\nfunction Component({ isSpecial, shouldFetch, fetchPromise }) {\n  // ✅ Hooks at top level\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  const [name, setName] = useState('');\n\n  if (!isSpecial) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  if (shouldFetch) {\n    // ✅ `use` can be conditional\n    const data = use(fetchPromise);\n    return <div>{data}</div>;\n  }\n\n  return <div>{name}: {count}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Avoid Mutating Hook Arguments Directly (Bad Example)\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/rules/components-and-hooks-must-be-pure.md\n\nDemonstrates an incorrect practice of directly modifying an object passed as an argument to a custom React Hook. Mutating hook arguments can lead to unpredictable behavior and break memoization optimizations within the hook, violating the immutability principle.\n\n```js\nfunction useIconStyle(icon) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  if (icon.enabled) {\n    icon.className = computeStyle(icon, theme); // Ⓣ Bad: never mutate hook arguments directly\n  }\n  return icon;\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Consuming React Context with useContext Hook\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/scaling-up-with-reducer-and-context.md\n\nThis example shows how a functional component, `TaskList`, directly accesses the `tasks` array from `TasksContext` using the `useContext` hook. This pattern allows components to retrieve necessary data from the context without receiving it as props from their parents.\n\n```javascript\nexport default function TaskList() {\n  const tasks = useContext(TasksContext);\n  // ...\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### React `ChatRoom` Component Passing `onReceiveMessage` Prop\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks.md\n\nThis React component demonstrates how to pass a custom `onReceiveMessage` event handler as a prop to the `useChatRoom` hook. This approach allows the component to define what action to take when a new message is received from the chat, making the hook more flexible.\n\n```js\nexport default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n  useChatRoom({\n    roomId: roomId,\n    serverUrl: serverUrl,\n    onReceiveMessage(msg) {\n      showNotification('New message: ' + msg);\n    }\n  });\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Correcting `use` Hook Placement in React Components\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/react/use.md\n\nThis snippet illustrates the incorrect and correct ways to use the `use` hook in React. The first example shows an anti-pattern where `use` is called within a nested function closure, which is not a React Component or Hook. The second example demonstrates the proper usage, calling `use` directly within the functional component, adhering to React's rules for hooks.\n\n```jsx\nfunction MessageComponent({messagePromise}) {\n  function download() {\n    // ❌ the function calling `use` is not a Component or Hook\n    const message = use(messagePromise);\n    // ...\n\n```\n\n```jsx\nfunction MessageComponent({messagePromise}) {\n  // ✅ `use` is being called from a component. \n  const message = use(messagePromise);\n  // ...\n\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Implement useCounter Custom Hook and Refactor Counter Component (React)\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks.md\n\nThis solution extracts the counter logic into a `useCounter` custom Hook, making the `Counter` component cleaner and reusable. The `useCounter` Hook encapsulates the `useState` and `useEffect` logic, returning the current count.\n\n```javascript\nimport { useCounter } from './useCounter.js';\n\nexport default function Counter() {\n  const count = useCounter();\n  return <h1>Seconds passed: {count}</h1>;\n}\n```\n\n```javascript\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\nexport function useCounter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const id = setInterval(() => {\n      setCount(c => c + 1);\n    }, 1000);\n    return () => clearInterval(id);\n  }, []);\n  return count;\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Implement dynamic React components by passing JSX as children in JavaScript\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/lints/component-hook-factories.md\n\nThis code snippet demonstrates the correct way to achieve dynamic component behavior in React by passing JSX as children. This approach avoids factory functions, ensuring component stability, preserving state, and maintaining good performance. It's the recommended pattern for flexible component rendering.\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Better: Pass JSX as children\nfunction Button({color, children}) {\n  return (\n    <button style={{backgroundColor: color}}>\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Button color=\"red\">Red</Button>\n      <Button color=\"blue\">Blue</Button>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Integrate `useList` custom Hook into a React component\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/react/cloneElement.md\n\nThis `App` component demonstrates how to consume the `useList` custom Hook. It destructures `selected` and `onNext` from the hook, rendering a list of products and a button to navigate through them, highlighting the currently selected item based on the hook's state.\n\n```javascript\nexport default function App() {\n  const [selected, onNext] = useList(products);\n  return (\n    <div className=\"List\">\n      {products.map(product =>\n        <Row\n          key={product.id}\n          title={product.title}\n          isHighlighted={selected === product}\n        />\n      )}\n      <hr />\n      <button onClick={onNext}>\n        Next\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Separating Concerns with Multiple React `useEffect` Hooks\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects.md\n\nThis example illustrates the best practice of using multiple `useEffect` hooks to manage distinct synchronization processes. One effect handles analytics logging (`logVisit`) when `roomId` changes, while another independently manages the chat room connection. This separation prevents unintended side effects and improves maintainability.\n\n```js\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    logVisit(roomId);\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n    // ...\n  }, [roomId]);\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Render React Component with Custom useFadeIn Hook\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks.md\n\nThis React JavaScript code defines an `App` component that controls the visibility of a `Welcome` component using `useState`. The `Welcome` component then utilizes a custom `useFadeIn` hook with `useRef` to apply a fade-in animation to an `h1` element when rendered, demonstrating imperative animation logic encapsulated in a hook.\n\n```js\nimport { useState, useEffect, useRef } from 'react';\nimport { useFadeIn } from './useFadeIn.js';\n\nfunction Welcome() {\n  const ref = useRef(null);\n\n  useFadeIn(ref, 1000);\n\n  return (\n    <h1 className=\"welcome\" ref={ref}>\n      Welcome\n    </h1>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [show, setShow] = useState(false);\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => setShow(!show)}>\n        {show ? 'Remove' : 'Show'}\n      </button>\n      <hr />\n      {show && <Welcome />}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### React useData Custom Hook for Centralized Data Fetching\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks.md\n\nThis custom React hook encapsulates the common data fetching logic from the `ShippingForm` component. It takes a URL as input and returns the fetched data, abstracting `useState` and `useEffect` to provide a cleaner API for components.\n\n```js\nfunction useData(url) {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (url) {\n      let ignore = false;\n      fetch(url)\n        .then(response => response.json())\n        .then(json => {\n          if (!ignore) {\n            setData(json);\n          }\n        });\n      return () => {\n        ignore = true;\n      };\n    }\n  }, [url]);\n  return data;\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Avoid Mutating Hook Arguments After Passing to Hook (Bad Example)\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/rules/components-and-hooks-must-be-pure.md\n\nDemonstrates the issue of mutating a variable (`icon`) *after* it has been passed as an argument to a hook (`useIconStyle`). If the hook's return value is memoized based on the original `icon` reference, subsequent mutations to `icon` outside the hook will not trigger re-computation, leading to stale results. This highlights the importance of treating hook arguments as immutable.\n\n```js\nstyle = useIconStyle(icon);         // `style` is memoized based on `icon`\nicon.enabled = false;               // Bad: Ⓣ never mutate hook arguments directly\nstyle = useIconStyle(icon);         // previously memoized result is returned\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Avoid Mutating Values After Being Passed to JSX (Bad Example)\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/rules/components-and-hooks-must-be-pure.md\n\nIllustrates an incorrect practice where an object (`styles`) is mutated *after* it has already been passed as a prop to a JSX element (`<Header styles={styles} />`). React might eagerly evaluate JSX, meaning the `Header` component will receive the original `styles` object. Subsequent mutation of `styles` will not update the `Header`, leading to an outdated UI and breaking local reasoning.\n\n```js\nfunction Page({ colour }) {\n  const styles = { colour, size: \"large\" };\n  const header = <Header styles={styles} />;\n  styles.size = \"small\"; // Ⓣ Bad: styles was already used in the JSX above\n  const footer = <Footer styles={styles} />;\n  return (\n    <>\n      {header}\n      <Content />\n      {footer}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Correctly Handle Hook Arguments by Copying (Good Example)\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/rules/components-and-hooks-must-be-pure.md\n\nIllustrates the correct approach to modify an object received as a hook argument. Instead of direct mutation, a new copy of the object (`newIcon`) is created, and modifications are applied to the copy. This preserves immutability and ensures predictable hook behavior, especially with memoization.\n\n```js\nfunction useIconStyle(icon) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  const newIcon = { ...icon }; // ✅ Good: make a copy instead\n  if (newIcon.enabled) {\n    newIcon.className = computeStyle(newIcon, theme);\n  }\n  return newIcon;\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Define React ChatRoom Component with useChatRoom Hook\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks.md\n\nThis React functional component displays a chat room interface, manages its local 'serverUrl' state, and integrates a custom 'useChatRoom' hook to handle connection logic based on the provided 'roomId' and current 'serverUrl'. It sets up the UI for users to view the room and adjust the server.\n\n```javascript\nexport default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');\n\n  useChatRoom({\n    roomId: roomId,\n    serverUrl: serverUrl\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Server URL:\n        <input value={serverUrl} onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)} />\n      </label>\n      <h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Client-side Data Fetching in React with Effects and API\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/rsc/server-components.md\n\nDemonstrates a common pattern for fetching dynamic data in React applications using `useState` and `useEffect` hooks on the client-side. It also includes corresponding server-side API endpoints that serve the data. This approach often leads to client-server waterfalls due to sequential client-side fetches.\n\n```js\n// bundle.js\nfunction Note({id}) {\n  const [note, setNote] = useState('');\n  // NOTE: loads *after* first render.\n  useEffect(() => {\n    fetch(`/api/notes/${id}`).then(data => {\n      setNote(data.note);\n    });\n  }, [id]);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Author id={note.authorId} />\n      <p>{note}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction Author({id}) {\n  const [author, setAuthor] = useState('');\n  // NOTE: loads *after* Note renders.\n  // Causing an expensive client-server waterfall.\n  useEffect(() => {\n    fetch(`/api/authors/${id}`).then(data => {\n      setAuthor(data.author);\n    });\n  }, [id]);\n\n  return <span>By: {author.name}</span>;\n}\n```\n\n```js\n// api\nimport db from './database';\n\napp.get(`/api/notes/:id`, async (req, res) => {\n  const note = await db.notes.get(id);\n  res.send({note});\n});\n\napp.get(`/api/authors/:id`, async (req, res) => {\n  const author = await db.authors.get(id);\n  res.send({author});\n});\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Encapsulate Online Status Logic in a Custom React Hook\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/react/useSyncExternalStore.md\n\nDemonstrates how to create a reusable custom React hook, `useOnlineStatus`, that leverages `useSyncExternalStore` to track the browser's network status. This hook abstracts away the subscription and snapshot logic, making it easy for multiple components to consume the online status. The example includes an `App` component with `StatusBar` and `SaveButton` components that both utilize the `useOnlineStatus` hook.\n\n```js\nimport { useOnlineStatus } from './useOnlineStatus.js';\n\nfunction StatusBar() {\n  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();\n  return <h1>{isOnline ? '✅ Online' : '❌ Disconnected'}</h1>;\n}\n\nfunction SaveButton() {\n  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();\n\n  function handleSaveClick() {\n    console.log('✅ Progress saved');\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <button disabled={!isOnline} onClick={handleSaveClick}>\n      {isOnline ? 'Save progress' : 'Reconnecting...'}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <SaveButton />\n      <StatusBar />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n```js\nimport { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';\n\nexport function useOnlineStatus() {\n  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);\n  return isOnline;\n}\n\nfunction getSnapshot() {\n  return navigator.onLine;\n}\n\nfunction subscribe(callback) {\n  window.addEventListener('online', callback);\n  window.addEventListener('offline', callback);\n  return () => {\n    window.removeEventListener('online', callback);\n    window.removeEventListener('offline', callback);\n  };\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### React Custom Hooks for Task Context Access\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/scaling-up-with-reducer-and-context.md\n\nDefines `useTasks` and `useTasksDispatch` custom hooks. These hooks encapsulate the `useContext` calls, providing a cleaner and more maintainable way for components to access the task state and dispatch function from the `TasksContext`.\n\n```js\nexport function useTasks() {\n  return useContext(TasksContext);\n}\n\nexport function useTasksDispatch() {\n  return useContext(TasksDispatchContext);\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### React App Component for Chat Room Selection\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks.md\n\nThis React functional component, `App`, serves as the main application entry point. It manages the `roomId` state using the `useState` hook and provides a dropdown (`select` element) for users to choose different chat rooms. The selected `roomId` is then passed as a prop to the `ChatRoom` component, illustrating how reactive values are managed and passed down the component tree.\n\n```javascript\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport ChatRoom from './ChatRoom.js';\n\nexport default function App() {\n  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');\n  return (\n    <>\n      <label>\n        Choose the chat room:{' '}\n        <select\n          value={roomId}\n          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}\n        >\n          <option value=\"general\">general</option>\n          <option value=\"travel\">travel</option>\n          <option value=\"music\">music</option>\n        </select>\n      </label>\n      <hr />\n      <ChatRoom\n        roomId={roomId}\n      />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Memoize Hook Return Values Based on Immutable Arguments\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/rules/components-and-hooks-must-be-pure.md\n\nShows how `useMemo` can be used within a custom hook to optimize performance by memoizing computed values. The `newIcon` object is created and modified within the `useMemo` callback, ensuring that the computation is re-run only when the `icon` or `theme` dependencies change. This approach relies on the immutability of `icon` and `theme`.\n\n```js\nfunction useIconStyle(icon) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n\n  return useMemo(() => {\n    const newIcon = { ...icon };\n    if (newIcon.enabled) {\n      newIcon.className = computeStyle(newIcon, theme);\n    }\n    return newIcon;\n  }, [icon, theme]);\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Using useContext for Global State in React\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/react/hooks.md\n\nIllustrates how to consume a React Context using the `useContext` Hook. This allows components to access information from distant parent components without prop drilling, useful for themes or user settings.\n\n```javascript\nfunction Button() {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  // ...\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Calling React Components: Avoid Direct Function Calls in JavaScript\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/rules/react-calls-components-and-hooks.md\n\nReact components should only be invoked through JSX, allowing React to manage their lifecycle and state. Direct function calls to components can violate the Rules of Hooks and prevent React from optimizing rendering, debugging, and reconciliation processes.\n\n```javascript\nfunction BlogPost() {\n  return <Layout><Article /></Layout>; // ✅ Good: Only use components in JSX\n}\n```\n\n```javascript\nfunction BlogPost() {\n  return <Layout>{Article()}</Layout>; // 🔴 Bad: Never call them directly\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Correct React Hook Placement (Solution 1)\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/learn/state-a-components-memory.md\n\nThis solution fixes the conditional hook call issue by moving the `useState` hook for `message` outside the `if/else` block. This ensures that all hooks are called unconditionally at the top level of the component function, adhering to React's Rules of Hooks and preventing crashes.\n\n```js\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nexport default function FeedbackForm() {\n  const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false);\n  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');\n\n  if (isSent) {\n    return <h1>Thank you!</h1>;\n  } else {\n    return (\n      <form onSubmit={e => {\n        e.preventDefault();\n        alert(`Sending: \"${message}\"`);\n        setIsSent(true);\n      }}>\n        <textarea\n          placeholder=\"Message\"\n          value={message}\n          onChange={e => setMessage(e.target.value)}\n        />\n        <br />\n        <button type=\"submit\">Send</button>\n      </form>\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Correct useFormStatus Usage: Hook in Child Component of Form\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/react-dom/hooks/useFormStatus.md\n\nDemonstrates the correct usage of `useFormStatus` by calling it from a component (`Submit`) that is rendered as a child *inside* the `<form>`. This ensures the hook correctly tracks the parent form's submission status.\n\n```javascript\nfunction Submit() {\n  // ✅ `pending` will be derived from the form that wraps the Submit component\n  const { pending } = useFormStatus(); \n  return <button disabled={pending}>...</button>;\n}\n\nfunction Form() {\n  // This is the <form> `useFormStatus` tracks\n  return (\n    <form action={submit}>\n      <Submit />\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n--------------------------------\n\n### Correctly Handle JSX Props by Creating New Objects (Good Example)\n\nSource: https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/blob/main/src/content/reference/rules/components-and-hooks-must-be-pure.md\n\nDemonstrates the correct way to provide different prop values to JSX elements. Instead of mutating an existing object, a new object (`footerStyles`) is created with the desired values for the `Footer` component. This ensures that each component receives its own distinct set of props, maintaining immutability and predictable rendering behavior in React.\n\n```js\nfunction Page({ colour }) {\n  const headerStyles = { colour, size: \"large\" };\n  const header = <Header styles={headerStyles} />;\n  const footerStyles = { colour, size: \"small\" }; // ✅ Good: we created a new value\n  const footer = <Footer styles={footerStyles} />;\n  return (\n    <>\n      {header}\n      <Content />\n      {footer}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```"}]}

Class components are legacy.\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Functional component\nfunction UserProfile({ userId }) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n  return <div>{user?.name}</div>;\n}\n\n// ❌ Avoid: Class components (legacy)\nclass UserProfile extends React.Component {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n### Component Definition Rules\n- Define components at the module level, never inside other components\n- Avoid factory functions that create components\n- Components should be stable across renders\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Component defined at module level\nfunction Button({ color, children }) {\n  return <button style={{ backgroundColor: color }}>{children}</button>;\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  return <Button color=\"red\">Click me</Button>;\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Component defined inside another component\nfunction Parent() {\n  function Child() {  // Re-created on every render!\n    return <div>Child</div>;\n  }\n  return <Child />;\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Factory function creating components\nfunction createComponent(defaultValue) {\n  return function Component() {\n    // ...\n  };\n}\n```\n\n## Hooks Best Practices\n\n### Rules of Hooks\n1. Only call hooks at the top level of function components or custom hooks\n2. Never call hooks conditionally, in loops, or after early returns\n3. Hook calls must be in the same order on every render\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Hooks at top level\nfunction Component({ isSpecial }) {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  const [name, setName] = useState('');\n\n  if (!isSpecial) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  return <div>{name}: {count}</div>;\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Conditional hook\nfunction Component({ isLoggedIn }) {\n  if (isLoggedIn) {\n    const [user, setUser] = useState(null); // Violates Rules of Hooks!\n  }\n  return <div>...</div>;\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Hook after early return\nfunction Component({ data }) {\n  if (!data) return <Loading />;\n  const [processed, setProcessed] = useState(data); // Never called when data is null!\n  return <div>{processed}</div>;\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Hook in callback\nfunction Component() {\n  return (\n    <button onClick={() => {\n      const [clicked, setClicked] = useState(false); // Hooks can't be in event handlers!\n    }}>\n      Click\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### useState Hook\n- Use for local component state\n- State setter functions can accept updater functions for atomic updates\n- Multiple useState calls are better than complex state objects for unrelated data\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Separate state for independent values\nfunction Form() {\n  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');\n  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');\n  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');\n  // ...\n}\n\n// ✅ Good: Updater function for state based on previous state\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  const increment = () => {\n    setCount(c => c + 1); // Uses previous value\n  };\n\n  return <button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>;\n}\n```\n\n### useEffect Hook\n- Use for synchronization with external systems (APIs, subscriptions, DOM)\n- Always return cleanup functions when needed\n- Specify all dependencies in the dependency array\n- Separate unrelated effects into different useEffect calls\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Separate effects for separate concerns\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    logVisit(roomId);\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n  // ...\n}\n\n// ✅ Good: Cleanup function for subscriptions\nuseEffect(() => {\n  const subscription = subscribe(callback);\n  return () => subscription.unsubscribe();\n}, [callback]);\n\n// ❌ Avoid: Multiple concerns in one effect\nuseEffect(() => {\n  logVisit(roomId);\n  const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n  connection.connect();\n  return () => connection.disconnect();\n}, [roomId]); // Mixes analytics and connection logic\n```\n\n### useContext Hook\n- Use for accessing context values\n- Wrap context access in custom hooks for better ergonomics\n- Context providers should be at appropriate levels in the tree\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Custom hooks for context access\nexport function useTasks() {\n  return useContext(TasksContext);\n}\n\nexport function useTasksDispatch() {\n  return useContext(TasksDispatchContext);\n}\n\n// Usage in components\nfunction TaskList() {\n  const tasks = useTasks();\n  const dispatch = useTasksDispatch();\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n### useCallback Hook\n- Use to memoize callback functions\n- Essential when passing callbacks to optimized child components\n- Custom hooks should wrap returned functions in useCallback\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Memoize callbacks in custom hooks\nfunction useRouter() {\n  const { dispatch } = useContext(RouterStateContext);\n\n  const navigate = useCallback((url) => {\n    dispatch({ type: 'navigate', url });\n  }, [dispatch]);\n\n  const goBack = useCallback(() => {\n    dispatch({ type: 'back' });\n  }, [dispatch]);\n\n  return { navigate, goBack };\n}\n```\n\n### useMemo Hook\n- Use to memoize expensive computations\n- Helps optimize performance when combined with immutable arguments\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Memoize expensive computations\nfunction useIconStyle(icon) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n\n  return useMemo(() => {\n    const newIcon = { ...icon };\n    if (newIcon.enabled) {\n      newIcon.className = computeStyle(newIcon, theme);\n    }\n    return newIcon;\n  }, [icon, theme]);\n}\n```\n\n## Custom Hooks\n\n### Purpose and Naming\n- Extract reusable stateful logic into custom hooks\n- Always prefix custom hooks with \"use\"\n- Custom hooks enable logic sharing without component hierarchy changes\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Custom hook for form input logic\nfunction useFormInput(initialValue) {\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);\n\n  const handleChange = (e) => {\n    setValue(e.target.value);\n  };\n\n  return {\n    value,\n    onChange: handleChange\n  };\n}\n\n// Usage\nfunction Form() {\n  const firstNameProps = useFormInput('Mary');\n  const lastNameProps = useFormInput('Poppins');\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <input {...firstNameProps} />\n      <input {...lastNameProps} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Custom Hook Best Practices\n- Never pass hooks as props or create higher-order hooks\n- Don't mutate hook arguments\n- Avoid custom \"lifecycle\" hooks that just wrap useEffect\n- Return stable function references with useCallback\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ Bad: Don't pass hooks as props\nfunction ChatInput() {\n  return <Button useData={useDataWithLogging} />\n}\n\n// ✅ Good: Call hooks directly where needed\nfunction ChatInput() {\n  return <Button />\n}\n\nfunction Button() {\n  const data = useDataWithLogging();\n  // ...\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Custom lifecycle hooks\nfunction useMount(fn) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    fn();\n  }, []); // Missing dependency: fn\n}\n\n// ✅ Good: Use useEffect directly with proper dependencies\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  }, [roomId]);\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Don't mutate hook arguments\nfunction useIconStyle(icon) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  if (icon.enabled) {\n    icon.className = computeStyle(icon, theme); // Mutation!\n  }\n  return icon;\n}\n\n// ✅ Good: Create new objects instead\nfunction useIconStyle(icon) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  const newIcon = { ...icon };\n  if (newIcon.enabled) {\n    newIcon.className = computeStyle(newIcon, theme);\n  }\n  return newIcon;\n}\n```\n\n### Common Custom Hook Patterns\n\n#### Data Fetching Hook\n```javascript\nfunction useData(url) {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (!url) return;\n\n    let ignore = false;\n    fetch(url)\n      .then(response => response.json())\n      .then(json => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setData(json);\n        }\n      });\n\n    return () => {\n      ignore = true;\n    };\n  }, [url]);\n\n  return data;\n}\n\n// Usage\nfunction ShippingForm({ country }) {\n  const cities = useData(`/api/cities?country=${country}`);\n  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);\n  const areas = useData(city ? `/api/areas?city=${city}` : null);\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n#### External Store Subscription Hook\n```javascript\nfunction useOnlineStatus() {\n  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);\n  return isOnline;\n}\n\nfunction getSnapshot() {\n  return navigator.onLine;\n}\n\nfunction subscribe(callback) {\n  window.addEventListener('online', callback);\n  window.addEventListener('offline', callback);\n  return () => {\n    window.removeEventListener('online', callback);\n    window.removeEventListener('offline', callback);\n  };\n}\n```\n\n## Component Patterns\n\n### Composition Over Hierarchy\n- Pass JSX as children for flexibility\n- Use render props when children need access to internal state\n- Avoid deeply nested prop drilling\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Composition with children\nfunction Card({ children, title }) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"card\">\n      <h2>{title}</h2>\n      {children}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Card title=\"User Profile\">\n      <UserAvatar />\n      <UserDetails />\n    </Card>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Event Handlers\n- Define event handlers inside the component\n- Use arrow functions for handlers that need parameters\n- Avoid creating new function references unnecessarily in render\n\n```javascript\nfunction Button() {\n  const handleClick = () => {\n    console.log('clicked');\n  };\n\n  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;\n}\n\n// With parameters\nfunction ItemList({ items }) {\n  const handleItemClick = (id) => {\n    console.log('Item clicked:', id);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {items.map(item => (\n        <li key={item.id} onClick={() => handleItemClick(item.id)}>\n          {item.name}\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Purity and Immutability\n\n### Component Purity\n- Components should be pure functions of their props\n- Never mutate props or state directly\n- Avoid side effects in the render phase\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Pure component\nfunction UserGreeting({ user }) {\n  return <h1>Hello, {user.name}!</h1>;\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Mutating props\nfunction UserGreeting({ user }) {\n  user.lastSeen = new Date(); // Never mutate props!\n  return <h1>Hello, {user.name}!</h1>;\n}\n```\n\n### Immutability in State Updates\n- Always create new objects/arrays for state updates\n- Use spread operators for shallow copies\n- Use array methods that return new arrays (map, filter, etc.)\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Immutable state updates\nfunction TodoList() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    setTodos([...todos, { id: Date.now(), text }]);\n  };\n\n  const removeTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.filter(todo => todo.id !== id));\n  };\n\n  const toggleTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.map(todo =>\n      todo.id === id ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed } : todo\n    ));\n  };\n\n  // ...\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Mutating state\nfunction TodoList() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    todos.push({ id: Date.now(), text }); // Mutation!\n    setTodos(todos); // Won't trigger re-render correctly\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### JSX and Props Immutability\n- Never mutate values after passing to JSX\n- Create new objects for different props\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Create new objects for different props\nfunction Page({ colour }) {\n  const headerStyles = { colour, size: \"large\" };\n  const header = <Header styles={headerStyles} />;\n  const footerStyles = { colour, size: \"small\" };\n  const footer = <Footer styles={footerStyles} />;\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      {header}\n      <Content />\n      {footer}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Mutating after passing to JSX\nfunction Page({ colour }) {\n  const styles = { colour, size: \"large\" };\n  const header = <Header styles={styles} />;\n  styles.size = \"small\"; // Mutation after use in JSX!\n  const footer = <Footer styles={styles} />;\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      {header}\n      <Content />\n      {footer}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\n### When to Optimize\n- Measure before optimizing\n- Use React DevTools Profiler\n- Focus on slow renders and unnecessary re-renders\n\n### Optimization Techniques\n1. **React.memo** - Memoize components to prevent re-renders\n2. **useMemo** - Memoize expensive computations\n3. **useCallback** - Memoize callback functions\n4. **Code splitting** - Lazy load components\n5. **Virtualization** - Render only visible items in long lists\n\n```javascript\n// Memoized component\nconst MemoizedComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent({ data }) {\n  return <div>{data}</div>;\n});\n\n// With custom comparison\nconst MemoizedComponent = React.memo(\n  function MyComponent({ data }) {\n    return <div>{data}</div>;\n  },\n  (prevProps, nextProps) => {\n    return prevProps.data.id === nextProps.data.id;\n  }\n);\n```\n\n## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n1. **Don't use indexes as keys in lists** (unless list is static and items don't have unique IDs)\n2. **Don't call hooks conditionally**\n3. **Don't mutate state or props**\n4. **Don't create components inside components**\n5. **Don't pass hooks as props**\n6. **Avoid deeply nested prop drilling** (use context instead)\n7. **Don't use useEffect for derived state** (calculate during render instead)\n8. **Avoid unnecessary state** (derive from props when possible)\n\n## Modern React Features\n\n### Concurrent Features\n- React 18+ supports concurrent rendering\n- Use `useTransition` for non-urgent updates\n- Use `useDeferredValue` for deferring expensive renders\n\n### Server Components (Next.js, etc.)\n- Server Components fetch data on the server\n- Reduce client-side JavaScript bundle size\n- Better initial page load performance\n\n### Suspense\n- Handle loading states declaratively\n- Works with lazy loading and data fetching\n- Enables better user experiences during async operations\n\n```javascript\n// Lazy loading with Suspense\nconst LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n      <LazyComponent />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n```\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":5,"cache_creation_input_tokens":491,"cache_read_input_tokens":36934,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":491,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":25,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CUHbiwt7nv26aCZvyAhTr","type":"assistant","uuid":"ab08f154-dfaf-4334-8d2c-cf5f8ae747cb","timestamp":"2025-10-20T01:42:15.849Z"}

Class components are legacy.\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Functional component\nfunction UserProfile({ userId }) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n  return <div>{user?.name}</div>;\n}\n\n// ❌ Avoid: Class components (legacy)\nclass UserProfile extends React.Component {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n### Component Definition Rules\n- Define components at the module level, never inside other components\n- Avoid factory functions that create components\n- Components should be stable across renders\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Component defined at module level\nfunction Button({ color, children }) {\n  return <button style={{ backgroundColor: color }}>{children}</button>;\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  return <Button color=\"red\">Click me</Button>;\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Component defined inside another component\nfunction Parent() {\n  function Child() {  // Re-created on every render!\n    return <div>Child</div>;\n  }\n  return <Child />;\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Factory function creating components\nfunction createComponent(defaultValue) {\n  return function Component() {\n    // ...\n  };\n}\n```\n\n## Hooks Best Practices\n\n### Rules of Hooks\n1. Only call hooks at the top level of function components or custom hooks\n2. Never call hooks conditionally, in loops, or after early returns\n3. Hook calls must be in the same order on every render\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Hooks at top level\nfunction Component({ isSpecial }) {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  const [name, setName] = useState('');\n\n  if (!isSpecial) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  return <div>{name}: {count}</div>;\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Conditional hook\nfunction Component({ isLoggedIn }) {\n  if (isLoggedIn) {\n    const [user, setUser] = useState(null); // Violates Rules of Hooks!\n  }\n  return <div>...</div>;\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Hook after early return\nfunction Component({ data }) {\n  if (!data) return <Loading />;\n  const [processed, setProcessed] = useState(data); // Never called when data is null!\n  return <div>{processed}</div>;\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Hook in callback\nfunction Component() {\n  return (\n    <button onClick={() => {\n      const [clicked, setClicked] = useState(false); // Hooks can't be in event handlers!\n    }}>\n      Click\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### useState Hook\n- Use for local component state\n- State setter functions can accept updater functions for atomic updates\n- Multiple useState calls are better than complex state objects for unrelated data\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Separate state for independent values\nfunction Form() {\n  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');\n  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');\n  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');\n  // ...\n}\n\n// ✅ Good: Updater function for state based on previous state\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  const increment = () => {\n    setCount(c => c + 1); // Uses previous value\n  };\n\n  return <button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>;\n}\n```\n\n### useEffect Hook\n- Use for synchronization with external systems (APIs, subscriptions, DOM)\n- Always return cleanup functions when needed\n- Specify all dependencies in the dependency array\n- Separate unrelated effects into different useEffect calls\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Separate effects for separate concerns\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    logVisit(roomId);\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n  // ...\n}\n\n// ✅ Good: Cleanup function for subscriptions\nuseEffect(() => {\n  const subscription = subscribe(callback);\n  return () => subscription.unsubscribe();\n}, [callback]);\n\n// ❌ Avoid: Multiple concerns in one effect\nuseEffect(() => {\n  logVisit(roomId);\n  const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n  connection.connect();\n  return () => connection.disconnect();\n}, [roomId]); // Mixes analytics and connection logic\n```\n\n### useContext Hook\n- Use for accessing context values\n- Wrap context access in custom hooks for better ergonomics\n- Context providers should be at appropriate levels in the tree\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Custom hooks for context access\nexport function useTasks() {\n  return useContext(TasksContext);\n}\n\nexport function useTasksDispatch() {\n  return useContext(TasksDispatchContext);\n}\n\n// Usage in components\nfunction TaskList() {\n  const tasks = useTasks();\n  const dispatch = useTasksDispatch();\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n### useCallback Hook\n- Use to memoize callback functions\n- Essential when passing callbacks to optimized child components\n- Custom hooks should wrap returned functions in useCallback\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Memoize callbacks in custom hooks\nfunction useRouter() {\n  const { dispatch } = useContext(RouterStateContext);\n\n  const navigate = useCallback((url) => {\n    dispatch({ type: 'navigate', url });\n  }, [dispatch]);\n\n  const goBack = useCallback(() => {\n    dispatch({ type: 'back' });\n  }, [dispatch]);\n\n  return { navigate, goBack };\n}\n```\n\n### useMemo Hook\n- Use to memoize expensive computations\n- Helps optimize performance when combined with immutable arguments\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Memoize expensive computations\nfunction useIconStyle(icon) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n\n  return useMemo(() => {\n    const newIcon = { ...icon };\n    if (newIcon.enabled) {\n      newIcon.className = computeStyle(newIcon, theme);\n    }\n    return newIcon;\n  }, [icon, theme]);\n}\n```\n\n## Custom Hooks\n\n### Purpose and Naming\n- Extract reusable stateful logic into custom hooks\n- Always prefix custom hooks with \"use\"\n- Custom hooks enable logic sharing without component hierarchy changes\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Custom hook for form input logic\nfunction useFormInput(initialValue) {\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);\n\n  const handleChange = (e) => {\n    setValue(e.target.value);\n  };\n\n  return {\n    value,\n    onChange: handleChange\n  };\n}\n\n// Usage\nfunction Form() {\n  const firstNameProps = useFormInput('Mary');\n  const lastNameProps = useFormInput('Poppins');\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <input {...firstNameProps} />\n      <input {...lastNameProps} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Custom Hook Best Practices\n- Never pass hooks as props or create higher-order hooks\n- Don't mutate hook arguments\n- Avoid custom \"lifecycle\" hooks that just wrap useEffect\n- Return stable function references with useCallback\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ Bad: Don't pass hooks as props\nfunction ChatInput() {\n  return <Button useData={useDataWithLogging} />\n}\n\n// ✅ Good: Call hooks directly where needed\nfunction ChatInput() {\n  return <Button />\n}\n\nfunction Button() {\n  const data = useDataWithLogging();\n  // ...\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Custom lifecycle hooks\nfunction useMount(fn) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    fn();\n  }, []); // Missing dependency: fn\n}\n\n// ✅ Good: Use useEffect directly with proper dependencies\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  }, [roomId]);\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Don't mutate hook arguments\nfunction useIconStyle(icon) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  if (icon.enabled) {\n    icon.className = computeStyle(icon, theme); // Mutation!\n  }\n  return icon;\n}\n\n// ✅ Good: Create new objects instead\nfunction useIconStyle(icon) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  const newIcon = { ...icon };\n  if (newIcon.enabled) {\n    newIcon.className = computeStyle(newIcon, theme);\n  }\n  return newIcon;\n}\n```\n\n### Common Custom Hook Patterns\n\n#### Data Fetching Hook\n```javascript\nfunction useData(url) {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (!url) return;\n\n    let ignore = false;\n    fetch(url)\n      .then(response => response.json())\n      .then(json => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setData(json);\n        }\n      });\n\n    return () => {\n      ignore = true;\n    };\n  }, [url]);\n\n  return data;\n}\n\n// Usage\nfunction ShippingForm({ country }) {\n  const cities = useData(`/api/cities?country=${country}`);\n  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);\n  const areas = useData(city ? `/api/areas?city=${city}` : null);\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n#### External Store Subscription Hook\n```javascript\nfunction useOnlineStatus() {\n  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);\n  return isOnline;\n}\n\nfunction getSnapshot() {\n  return navigator.onLine;\n}\n\nfunction subscribe(callback) {\n  window.addEventListener('online', callback);\n  window.addEventListener('offline', callback);\n  return () => {\n    window.removeEventListener('online', callback);\n    window.removeEventListener('offline', callback);\n  };\n}\n```\n\n## Component Patterns\n\n### Composition Over Hierarchy\n- Pass JSX as children for flexibility\n- Use render props when children need access to internal state\n- Avoid deeply nested prop drilling\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Composition with children\nfunction Card({ children, title }) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"card\">\n      <h2>{title}</h2>\n      {children}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Card title=\"User Profile\">\n      <UserAvatar />\n      <UserDetails />\n    </Card>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Event Handlers\n- Define event handlers inside the component\n- Use arrow functions for handlers that need parameters\n- Avoid creating new function references unnecessarily in render\n\n```javascript\nfunction Button() {\n  const handleClick = () => {\n    console.log('clicked');\n  };\n\n  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;\n}\n\n// With parameters\nfunction ItemList({ items }) {\n  const handleItemClick = (id) => {\n    console.log('Item clicked:', id);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {items.map(item => (\n        <li key={item.id} onClick={() => handleItemClick(item.id)}>\n          {item.name}\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Purity and Immutability\n\n### Component Purity\n- Components should be pure functions of their props\n- Never mutate props or state directly\n- Avoid side effects in the render phase\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Pure component\nfunction UserGreeting({ user }) {\n  return <h1>Hello, {user.name}!</h1>;\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Mutating props\nfunction UserGreeting({ user }) {\n  user.lastSeen = new Date(); // Never mutate props!\n  return <h1>Hello, {user.name}!</h1>;\n}\n```\n\n### Immutability in State Updates\n- Always create new objects/arrays for state updates\n- Use spread operators for shallow copies\n- Use array methods that return new arrays (map, filter, etc.)\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Immutable state updates\nfunction TodoList() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    setTodos([...todos, { id: Date.now(), text }]);\n  };\n\n  const removeTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.filter(todo => todo.id !== id));\n  };\n\n  const toggleTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.map(todo =>\n      todo.id === id ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed } : todo\n    ));\n  };\n\n  // ...\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Mutating state\nfunction TodoList() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    todos.push({ id: Date.now(), text }); // Mutation!\n    setTodos(todos); // Won't trigger re-render correctly\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### JSX and Props Immutability\n- Never mutate values after passing to JSX\n- Create new objects for different props\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Create new objects for different props\nfunction Page({ colour }) {\n  const headerStyles = { colour, size: \"large\" };\n  const header = <Header styles={headerStyles} />;\n  const footerStyles = { colour, size: \"small\" };\n  const footer = <Footer styles={footerStyles} />;\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      {header}\n      <Content />\n      {footer}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Mutating after passing to JSX\nfunction Page({ colour }) {\n  const styles = { colour, size: \"large\" };\n  const header = <Header styles={styles} />;\n  styles.size = \"small\"; // Mutation after use in JSX!\n  const footer = <Footer styles={styles} />;\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      {header}\n      <Content />\n      {footer}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\n### When to Optimize\n- Measure before optimizing\n- Use React DevTools Profiler\n- Focus on slow renders and unnecessary re-renders\n\n### Optimization Techniques\n1. **React.memo** - Memoize components to prevent re-renders\n2. **useMemo** - Memoize expensive computations\n3. **useCallback** - Memoize callback functions\n4. **Code splitting** - Lazy load components\n5. **Virtualization** - Render only visible items in long lists\n\n```javascript\n// Memoized component\nconst MemoizedComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent({ data }) {\n  return <div>{data}</div>;\n});\n\n// With custom comparison\nconst MemoizedComponent = React.memo(\n  function MyComponent({ data }) {\n    return <div>{data}</div>;\n  },\n  (prevProps, nextProps) => {\n    return prevProps.data.id === nextProps.data.id;\n  }\n);\n```\n\n## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n1. **Don't use indexes as keys in lists** (unless list is static and items don't have unique IDs)\n2. **Don't call hooks conditionally**\n3. **Don't mutate state or props**\n4. **Don't create components inside components**\n5. **Don't pass hooks as props**\n6. **Avoid deeply nested prop drilling** (use context instead)\n7. **Don't use useEffect for derived state** (calculate during render instead)\n8. **Avoid unnecessary state** (derive from props when possible)\n\n## Modern React Features\n\n### Concurrent Features\n- React 18+ supports concurrent rendering\n- Use `useTransition` for non-urgent updates\n- Use `useDeferredValue` for deferring expensive renders\n\n### Server Components (Next.js, etc.)\n- Server Components fetch data on the server\n- Reduce client-side JavaScript bundle size\n- Better initial page load performance\n\n### Suspense\n- Handle loading states declaratively\n- Works with lazy loading and data fetching\n- Enables better user experiences during async operations\n\n```javascript\n// Lazy loading with Suspense\nconst LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n      <LazyComponent />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n```\n","structuredPatch":[]}}

This includes writing new React components, refactoring existing code, implementing React hooks, managing state, handling component lifecycle, optimizing performance, and following modern React best practices. The skill is particularly useful for tasks involving functional components, hooks patterns, custom hooks, and modern React features like concurrent rendering.\n---\n\n# React Component Creator\n\n## Overview\n\nThis skill provides comprehensive guidance for creating high-quality, production-ready React components following modern best practices. Use it when building new React components, refactoring existing code, implementing custom hooks, or optimizing React applications for performance and maintainability.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\nInvoke this skill for:\n- Creating new React functional components from scratch\n- Implementing React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.)\n- Building custom hooks for reusable logic\n- Refactoring class components to functional components\n- Optimizing component performance\n- Managing component state and lifecycle\n- Implementing proper data fetching patterns\n- Following React purity and immutability principles\n- Addressing React-specific bugs or anti-patterns\n\n## Core Principles\n\nBefore implementing any React component, adhere to these fundamental principles:\n\n1. **Components are pure functions** - Same props always produce the same output\n2. **Never mutate props or state** - Always create new objects/arrays\n3. **Hooks follow strict rules** - Top-level only, consistent order, no conditional calls\n4. **Components defined at module level** - Never create components inside other components\n5. **Immutability throughout** - No mutations after values are passed to JSX or hooks\n\n## Component Creation Workflow\n\n### 1. Plan Component Structure\n\nBefore writing code, determine:\n- Is this a presentational or container component?\n- What props does it need?\n- What local state is required?\n- What side effects need to be managed?\n- Are custom hooks needed for reusable logic?\n\n### 2. Write the Component\n\nFollow this template structure for functional components:\n\n```javascript\nimport { useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo } from 'react';\n\nfunction ComponentName({ prop1, prop2 }) {\n  // 1. All hooks at the top level (never conditional)\n  const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);\n  const contextValue = useContext(SomeContext);\n\n  // 2. Derived values and memoization\n  const derivedValue = useMemo(() => {\n    return expensiveComputation(prop1, prop2);\n  }, [prop1, prop2]);\n\n  // 3. Event handlers and callbacks\n  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n    setState(newValue);\n  }, []);\n\n  // 4. Effects (for synchronization only)\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // Setup\n    const subscription = subscribe();\n\n    // Cleanup\n    return () => subscription.unsubscribe();\n  }, [dependencies]);\n\n  // 5. Early returns (after all hooks)\n  if (loading) return <Loading />;\n  if (error) return <Error message={error} />;\n\n  // 6. Render JSX\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>\n        {derivedValue}\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default ComponentName;\n```\n\n### 3. Validate Against Best Practices\n\nCheck the component against these criteria:\n- All hooks are called at the top level\n- No hooks after early returns or in conditionals\n- State is never mutated directly\n- Dependencies in useEffect/useCallback/useMemo are complete\n- Event handlers are properly defined\n- Props are not mutated\n- Component is defined at module level (not inside another component)\n\n### 4. Optimize if Needed\n\nApply optimizations only after measuring performance:\n- Wrap expensive computations in `useMemo`\n- Wrap callback functions in `useCallback` when passed to memoized children\n- Use `React.memo` for components that re-render unnecessarily\n- Consider code splitting for large components\n\n## Common Tasks\n\n### Creating a Form Component\n\n```javascript\nfunction LoginForm() {\n  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');\n  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');\n  const [error, setError] = useState(null);\n  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    setError(null);\n    setIsLoading(true);\n\n    try {\n      await login(email, password);\n    } catch (err) {\n      setError(err.message);\n    } finally {\n      setIsLoading(false);\n    }\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      <input\n        type=\"email\"\n        value={email}\n        onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}\n        disabled={isLoading}\n      />\n      <input\n        type=\"password\"\n        value={password}\n        onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}\n        disabled={isLoading}\n      />\n      {error && <div className=\"error\">{error}</div>}\n      <button type=\"submit\" disabled={isLoading}>\n        {isLoading ? 'Logging in...' : 'Login'}\n      </button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Creating a Custom Hook\n\nExtract reusable logic into custom hooks. Always prefix with \"use\":\n\n```javascript\n// Custom hook for form input management\nfunction useFormInput(initialValue) {\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);\n\n  const handleChange = useCallback((e) => {\n    setValue(e.target.value);\n  }, []);\n\n  const reset = useCallback(() => {\n    setValue(initialValue);\n  }, [initialValue]);\n\n  return {\n    value,\n    onChange: handleChange,\n    reset\n  };\n}\n\n// Usage in component\nfunction RegistrationForm() {\n  const emailInput = useFormInput('');\n  const passwordInput = useFormInput('');\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <input type=\"email\" {...emailInput} />\n      <input type=\"password\" {...passwordInput} />\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Data Fetching Pattern\n\nImplement proper data fetching with cleanup:\n\n```javascript\nfunction useData(url) {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n  const [error, setError] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (!url) return;\n\n    let ignore = false;\n    setLoading(true);\n\n    fetch(url)\n      .then(response => {\n        if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network error');\n        return response.json();\n      })\n      .then(json => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setData(json);\n          setError(null);\n        }\n      })\n      .catch(err => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setError(err.message);\n        }\n      })\n      .finally(() => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setLoading(false);\n        }\n      });\n\n    return () => {\n      ignore = true;\n    };\n  }, [url]);\n\n  return { data, loading, error };\n}\n\n// Usage\nfunction UserProfile({ userId }) {\n  const { data: user, loading, error } = useData(`/api/users/${userId}`);\n\n  if (loading) return <Loading />;\n  if (error) return <Error message={error} />;\n  if (!user) return null;\n\n  return <div>{user.name}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### Context and State Management\n\nImplement context with custom hooks for clean access:\n\n```javascript\n// Create context\nconst UserContext = createContext(null);\nconst UserDispatchContext = createContext(null);\n\n// Custom hooks for context access\nexport function useUser() {\n  const context = useContext(UserContext);\n  if (context === null) {\n    throw new Error('useUser must be used within UserProvider');\n  }\n  return context;\n}\n\nexport function useUserDispatch() {\n  const context = useContext(UserDispatchContext);\n  if (context === null) {\n    throw new Error('useUserDispatch must be used within UserProvider');\n  }\n  return context;\n}\n\n// Provider component\nexport function UserProvider({ children }) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n\n  const login = useCallback((userData) => {\n    setUser(userData);\n  }, []);\n\n  const logout = useCallback(() => {\n    setUser(null);\n  }, []);\n\n  const dispatch = useMemo(() => ({ login, logout }), [login, logout]);\n\n  return (\n    <UserContext.Provider value={user}>\n      <UserDispatchContext.Provider value={dispatch}>\n        {children}\n      </UserDispatchContext.Provider>\n    </UserContext.Provider>\n  );\n}\n\n// Usage in components\nfunction UserMenu() {\n  const user = useUser();\n  const { logout } = useUserDispatch();\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <span>{user.name}</span>\n      <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### List Rendering with Keys\n\nAlways use proper keys for list items:\n\n```javascript\nfunction TodoList({ todos }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {todos.map(todo => (\n        <TodoItem\n          key={todo.id}  // Use stable, unique ID\n          todo={todo}\n        />\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n\n// Managing list state immutably\nfunction TodoApp() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    const newTodo = { id: crypto.randomUUID(), text, completed: false };\n    setTodos([...todos, newTodo]);\n  };\n\n  const toggleTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.map(todo =>\n      todo.id === id ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed } : todo\n    ));\n  };\n\n  const removeTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.filter(todo => todo.id !== id));\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <TodoInput onAdd={addTodo} />\n      <TodoList\n        todos={todos}\n        onToggle={toggleTodo}\n        onRemove={removeTodo}\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Critical Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n### 1. Never Call Hooks Conditionally\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Component({ isLoggedIn }) {\n  if (isLoggedIn) {\n    const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n  }\n  return <div>...</div>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Component({ isLoggedIn }) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n\n  if (!isLoggedIn) return <Login />;\n\n  return <div>{user.name}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Never Mutate State or Props\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction TodoList({ todos }) {\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    todos.push({ text }); // Mutation!\n    setTodos(todos);\n  };\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction TodoList() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    setTodos([...todos, { text }]); // New array\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Never Define Components Inside Components\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Parent() {\n  function Child() {  // Re-created every render!\n    return <div>Child</div>;\n  }\n  return <Child />;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Child() {\n  return <div>Child</div>;\n}\n\nfunction Parent() {\n  return <Child />;\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Never Pass Hooks as Props\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Button({ useData }) {\n  const data = useData(); // Don't pass hooks as props\n  return <button>{data}</button>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Button() {\n  const data = useData(); // Call hooks directly\n  return <button>{data}</button>;\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Don't Use Effect for Derived State\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Component({ firstName, lastName }) {\n  const [fullName, setFullName] = useState('');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    setFullName(`${firstName} ${lastName}`);\n  }, [firstName, lastName]);\n\n  return <div>{fullName}</div>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Component({ firstName, lastName }) {\n  const fullName = `${firstName} ${lastName}`; // Derive during render\n  return <div>{fullName}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\n### Measure Before Optimizing\n\nUse React DevTools Profiler to identify actual performance issues. Don't prematurely optimize.\n\n### Memoization Techniques\n\n```javascript\n// Memoize expensive computations\nfunction ProductList({ products, category }) {\n  const filteredProducts = useMemo(() => {\n    return products.filter(p => p.category === category);\n  }, [products, category]);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {filteredProducts.map(product => (\n        <Product key={product.id} product={product} />\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n// Memoize callbacks passed to children\nfunction Parent() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n    setCount(c => c + 1);\n  }, []);\n\n  return <MemoizedChild onClick={handleClick} />;\n}\n\n// Memoize components\nconst MemoizedChild = React.memo(function Child({ onClick }) {\n  return <button onClick={onClick}>Click me</button>;\n});\n```\n\n## Reference Documentation\n\nFor comprehensive details on React best practices, patterns, and anti-patterns, refer to:\n- `references/react_best_practices.md` - Complete guide covering hooks, component patterns, purity, immutability, custom hooks, and modern React features\n\nLoad this reference when:\n- Implementing complex custom hooks\n- Debugging React-specific issues\n- Reviewing code for anti-patterns\n- Learning advanced patterns like context, reducers, or concurrent features\n- Optimizing performance\n\n## Implementation Checklist\n\nWhen creating or reviewing React components, verify:\n\n- [ ] Component defined at module level (not inside another component)\n- [ ] All hooks called at top level (no conditionals, loops, or early returns before hooks)\n- [ ] Hooks called in consistent order every render\n- [ ] State never mutated directly (always use setState with new values)\n- [ ] Props never mutated\n- [ ] No mutations after values passed to JSX\n- [ ] useEffect includes all dependencies\n- [ ] useEffect returns cleanup function when needed\n- [ ] Event handlers properly defined and named\n- [ ] Keys used correctly in list rendering (stable, unique IDs)\n- [ ] Derived state calculated during render (not in useEffect)\n- [ ] Custom hooks prefixed with \"use\"\n- [ ] Custom hooks follow Rules of Hooks\n- [ ] No hooks passed as props\n- [ ] Component is pure (same props → same output)\n- [ ] Performance optimizations only applied after measuring\n\n## Common Debugging Steps\n\nWhen encountering React issues:\n\n1. **State not updating**: Check for direct mutations, verify setState is called with new values\n2. **Infinite re-renders**: Check useEffect dependencies, verify state updates aren't unconditional\n3. **Stale closures**: Ensure dependencies are complete in useCallback/useMemo/useEffect\n4. **Hook errors**: Verify hooks are at top level, not conditional\n5. **Component not re-rendering**: Check if props/state are actually changing (reference equality)\n6. **Memory leaks**: Ensure useEffect cleanup functions properly cancel subscriptions\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":5,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1371,"cache_read_input_tokens":41949,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1371,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":18,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CUHbq5pmfnUhHTfYPFXEM","type":"assistant","uuid":"00782781-aabe-47e8-9d21-082a99d31ff4","timestamp":"2025-10-20T01:43:34.857Z"}

Use it when building new React components, refactoring existing code, implementing custom hooks, or optimizing React applications for performance and maintainability.\n    11→\n    12→## When to Use This Skill\n    13→\n    14→Invoke this skill for:\n    15→- Creating new React functional components from scratch\n    16→- Implementing React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.)\n    17→- Building custom hooks for reusable logic\n    18→- Refactoring class components to functional components\n    19→- Optimizing component performance\n    20→- Managing component state and lifecycle\n    21→- Implementing proper data fetching patterns\n    22→- Following React purity and immutability principles\n    23→- Addressing React-specific bugs or anti-patterns\n    24→\n    25→## Core Principles\n    26→\n    27→Before implementing any React component, adhere to these fundamental principles:\n    28→\n    29→1. **Components are pure functions** - Same props always produce the same output\n    30→2. **Never mutate props or state** - Always create new objects/arrays\n    31→3. **Hooks follow strict rules** - Top-level only, consistent order, no conditional calls\n    32→4. **Components defined at module level** - Never create components inside other components\n    33→5. **Immutability throughout** - No mutations after values are passed to JSX or hooks\n    34→\n    35→## Component Creation Workflow\n    36→\n    37→### 1. Plan Component Structure\n    38→\n    39→Before writing code, determine:\n    40→- Is this a presentational or container component?\n    41→- What props does it need?\n    42→- What local state is required?\n    43→- What side effects need to be managed?\n    44→- Are custom hooks needed for reusable logic?\n    45→\n    46→### 2. Write the Component\n    47→\n    48→Follow this template structure for functional components:\n    49→\n    50→```javascript\n    51→import { useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo } from 'react';\n    52→\n    53→function ComponentName({ prop1, prop2 }) {\n    54→  // 1. All hooks at the top level (never conditional)\n    55→  const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);\n    56→  const contextValue = useContext(SomeContext);\n    57→\n    58→  // 2. Derived values and memoization\n    59→  const derivedValue = useMemo(() => {\n    60→    return expensiveComputation(prop1, prop2);\n    61→  }, [prop1, prop2]);\n    62→\n    63→  // 3. Event handlers and callbacks\n    64→  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n    65→    setState(newValue);\n    66→  }, []);\n    67→\n    68→  // 4. Effects (for synchronization only)\n    69→  useEffect(() => {\n    70→    // Setup\n    71→    const subscription = subscribe();\n    72→\n    73→    // Cleanup\n    74→    return () => subscription.unsubscribe();\n    75→  }, [dependencies]);\n    76→\n    77→  // 5. Early returns (after all hooks)\n    78→  if (loading) return <Loading />;\n    79→  if (error) return <Error message={error} />;\n    80→\n    81→  // 6. Render JSX\n    82→  return (\n    83→    <div>\n    84→      <button onClick={handleClick}>\n    85→        {derivedValue}\n    86→      </button>\n    87→    </div>\n    88→  );\n    89→}\n    90→\n    91→export default ComponentName;\n    92→```\n    93→\n    94→### 3. Validate Against Best Practices\n    95→\n    96→Check the component against these criteria:\n    97→- All hooks are called at the top level\n    98→- No hooks after early returns or in conditionals\n    99→- State is never mutated directly\n   100→- Dependencies in useEffect/useCallback/useMemo are complete\n   101→- Event handlers are properly defined\n   102→- Props are not mutated\n   103→- Component is defined at module level (not inside another component)\n   104→\n   105→### 4. Optimize if Needed\n   106→\n   107→Apply optimizations only after measuring performance:\n   108→- Wrap expensive computations in `useMemo`\n   109→- Wrap callback functions in `useCallback` when passed to memoized children\n   110→- Use `React.memo` for components that re-render unnecessarily\n   111→- Consider code splitting for large components\n   112→\n   113→## Common Tasks\n   114→\n   115→### Creating a Form Component\n   116→\n   117→```javascript\n   118→function LoginForm() {\n   119→  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');\n   120→  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');\n   121→  const [error, setError] = useState(null);\n   122→  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);\n   123→\n   124→  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {\n   125→    e.preventDefault();\n   126→    setError(null);\n   127→    setIsLoading(true);\n   128→\n   129→    try {\n   130→      await login(email, password);\n   131→    } catch (err) {\n   132→      setError(err.message);\n   133→    } finally {\n   134→      setIsLoading(false);\n   135→    }\n   136→  };\n   137→\n   138→  return (\n   139→    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n   140→      <input\n   141→        type=\"email\"\n   142→        value={email}\n   143→        onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}\n   144→        disabled={isLoading}\n   145→      />\n   146→      <input\n   147→        type=\"password\"\n   148→        value={password}\n   149→        onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}\n   150→        disabled={isLoading}\n   151→      />\n   152→      {error && <div className=\"error\">{error}</div>}\n   153→      <button type=\"submit\" disabled={isLoading}>\n   154→        {isLoading ?

This includes writing new React components, refactoring existing code, implementing React hooks, managing state, handling component lifecycle, optimizing performance, and following modern React best practices. The skill is particularly useful for tasks involving functional components, hooks patterns, custom hooks, and modern React features like concurrent rendering.\n---\n\n# React Component Creator\n\n## Overview\n\nThis skill provides comprehensive guidance for creating high-quality, production-ready React components following modern best practices. Use it when building new React components, refactoring existing code, implementing custom hooks, or optimizing React applications for performance and maintainability.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\nInvoke this skill for:\n- Creating new React functional components from scratch\n- Implementing React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.)\n- Building custom hooks for reusable logic\n- Refactoring class components to functional components\n- Optimizing component performance\n- Managing component state and lifecycle\n- Implementing proper data fetching patterns\n- Following React purity and immutability principles\n- Addressing React-specific bugs or anti-patterns\n\n## Core Principles\n\nBefore implementing any React component, adhere to these fundamental principles:\n\n1. **Components are pure functions** - Same props always produce the same output\n2. **Never mutate props or state** - Always create new objects/arrays\n3. **Hooks follow strict rules** - Top-level only, consistent order, no conditional calls\n4. **Components defined at module level** - Never create components inside other components\n5. **Immutability throughout** - No mutations after values are passed to JSX or hooks\n\n## Component Creation Workflow\n\n### 1. Plan Component Structure\n\nBefore writing code, determine:\n- Is this a presentational or container component?\n- What props does it need?\n- What local state is required?\n- What side effects need to be managed?\n- Are custom hooks needed for reusable logic?\n\n### 2. Write the Component\n\nFollow this template structure for functional components:\n\n```javascript\nimport { useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo } from 'react';\n\nfunction ComponentName({ prop1, prop2 }) {\n  // 1. All hooks at the top level (never conditional)\n  const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);\n  const contextValue = useContext(SomeContext);\n\n  // 2. Derived values and memoization\n  const derivedValue = useMemo(() => {\n    return expensiveComputation(prop1, prop2);\n  }, [prop1, prop2]);\n\n  // 3. Event handlers and callbacks\n  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n    setState(newValue);\n  }, []);\n\n  // 4. Effects (for synchronization only)\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // Setup\n    const subscription = subscribe();\n\n    // Cleanup\n    return () => subscription.unsubscribe();\n  }, [dependencies]);\n\n  // 5. Early returns (after all hooks)\n  if (loading) return <Loading />;\n  if (error) return <Error message={error} />;\n\n  // 6. Render JSX\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>\n        {derivedValue}\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default ComponentName;\n```\n\n### 3. Validate Against Best Practices\n\nCheck the component against these criteria:\n- All hooks are called at the top level\n- No hooks after early returns or in conditionals\n- State is never mutated directly\n- Dependencies in useEffect/useCallback/useMemo are complete\n- Event handlers are properly defined\n- Props are not mutated\n- Component is defined at module level (not inside another component)\n\n### 4. Optimize if Needed\n\nApply optimizations only after measuring performance:\n- Wrap expensive computations in `useMemo`\n- Wrap callback functions in `useCallback` when passed to memoized children\n- Use `React.memo` for components that re-render unnecessarily\n- Consider code splitting for large components\n\n## Common Tasks\n\n### Creating a Form Component\n\n```javascript\nfunction LoginForm() {\n  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');\n  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');\n  const [error, setError] = useState(null);\n  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    setError(null);\n    setIsLoading(true);\n\n    try {\n      await login(email, password);\n    } catch (err) {\n      setError(err.message);\n    } finally {\n      setIsLoading(false);\n    }\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      <input\n        type=\"email\"\n        value={email}\n        onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}\n        disabled={isLoading}\n      />\n      <input\n        type=\"password\"\n        value={password}\n        onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}\n        disabled={isLoading}\n      />\n      {error && <div className=\"error\">{error}</div>}\n      <button type=\"submit\" disabled={isLoading}>\n        {isLoading ? 'Logging in...' : 'Login'}\n      </button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Creating a Custom Hook\n\nExtract reusable logic into custom hooks. Always prefix with \"use\":\n\n```javascript\n// Custom hook for form input management\nfunction useFormInput(initialValue) {\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);\n\n  const handleChange = useCallback((e) => {\n    setValue(e.target.value);\n  }, []);\n\n  const reset = useCallback(() => {\n    setValue(initialValue);\n  }, [initialValue]);\n\n  return {\n    value,\n    onChange: handleChange,\n    reset\n  };\n}\n\n// Usage in component\nfunction RegistrationForm() {\n  const emailInput = useFormInput('');\n  const passwordInput = useFormInput('');\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <input type=\"email\" {...emailInput} />\n      <input type=\"password\" {...passwordInput} />\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Data Fetching Pattern\n\nImplement proper data fetching with cleanup:\n\n```javascript\nfunction useData(url) {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n  const [error, setError] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (!url) return;\n\n    let ignore = false;\n    setLoading(true);\n\n    fetch(url)\n      .then(response => {\n        if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network error');\n        return response.json();\n      })\n      .then(json => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setData(json);\n          setError(null);\n        }\n      })\n      .catch(err => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setError(err.message);\n        }\n      })\n      .finally(() => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setLoading(false);\n        }\n      });\n\n    return () => {\n      ignore = true;\n    };\n  }, [url]);\n\n  return { data, loading, error };\n}\n\n// Usage\nfunction UserProfile({ userId }) {\n  const { data: user, loading, error } = useData(`/api/users/${userId}`);\n\n  if (loading) return <Loading />;\n  if (error) return <Error message={error} />;\n  if (!user) return null;\n\n  return <div>{user.name}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### Context and State Management\n\nImplement context with custom hooks for clean access:\n\n```javascript\n// Create context\nconst UserContext = createContext(null);\nconst UserDispatchContext = createContext(null);\n\n// Custom hooks for context access\nexport function useUser() {\n  const context = useContext(UserContext);\n  if (context === null) {\n    throw new Error('useUser must be used within UserProvider');\n  }\n  return context;\n}\n\nexport function useUserDispatch() {\n  const context = useContext(UserDispatchContext);\n  if (context === null) {\n    throw new Error('useUserDispatch must be used within UserProvider');\n  }\n  return context;\n}\n\n// Provider component\nexport function UserProvider({ children }) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n\n  const login = useCallback((userData) => {\n    setUser(userData);\n  }, []);\n\n  const logout = useCallback(() => {\n    setUser(null);\n  }, []);\n\n  const dispatch = useMemo(() => ({ login, logout }), [login, logout]);\n\n  return (\n    <UserContext.Provider value={user}>\n      <UserDispatchContext.Provider value={dispatch}>\n        {children}\n      </UserDispatchContext.Provider>\n    </UserContext.Provider>\n  );\n}\n\n// Usage in components\nfunction UserMenu() {\n  const user = useUser();\n  const { logout } = useUserDispatch();\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <span>{user.name}</span>\n      <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### List Rendering with Keys\n\nAlways use proper keys for list items:\n\n```javascript\nfunction TodoList({ todos }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {todos.map(todo => (\n        <TodoItem\n          key={todo.id}  // Use stable, unique ID\n          todo={todo}\n        />\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n\n// Managing list state immutably\nfunction TodoApp() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    const newTodo = { id: crypto.randomUUID(), text, completed: false };\n    setTodos([...todos, newTodo]);\n  };\n\n  const toggleTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.map(todo =>\n      todo.id === id ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed } : todo\n    ));\n  };\n\n  const removeTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.filter(todo => todo.id !== id));\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <TodoInput onAdd={addTodo} />\n      <TodoList\n        todos={todos}\n        onToggle={toggleTodo}\n        onRemove={removeTodo}\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Critical Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n### 1. Never Call Hooks Conditionally\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Component({ isLoggedIn }) {\n  if (isLoggedIn) {\n    const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n  }\n  return <div>...</div>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Component({ isLoggedIn }) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n\n  if (!isLoggedIn) return <Login />;\n\n  return <div>{user.name}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Never Mutate State or Props\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction TodoList({ todos }) {\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    todos.push({ text }); // Mutation!\n    setTodos(todos);\n  };\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction TodoList() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    setTodos([...todos, { text }]); // New array\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Never Define Components Inside Components\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Parent() {\n  function Child() {  // Re-created every render!\n    return <div>Child</div>;\n  }\n  return <Child />;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Child() {\n  return <div>Child</div>;\n}\n\nfunction Parent() {\n  return <Child />;\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Never Pass Hooks as Props\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Button({ useData }) {\n  const data = useData(); // Don't pass hooks as props\n  return <button>{data}</button>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Button() {\n  const data = useData(); // Call hooks directly\n  return <button>{data}</button>;\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Don't Use Effect for Derived State\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Component({ firstName, lastName }) {\n  const [fullName, setFullName] = useState('');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    setFullName(`${firstName} ${lastName}`);\n  }, [firstName, lastName]);\n\n  return <div>{fullName}</div>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Component({ firstName, lastName }) {\n  const fullName = `${firstName} ${lastName}`; // Derive during render\n  return <div>{fullName}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\n### Measure Before Optimizing\n\nUse React DevTools Profiler to identify actual performance issues. Don't prematurely optimize.\n\n### Memoization Techniques\n\n```javascript\n// Memoize expensive computations\nfunction ProductList({ products, category }) {\n  const filteredProducts = useMemo(() => {\n    return products.filter(p => p.category === category);\n  }, [products, category]);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {filteredProducts.map(product => (\n        <Product key={product.id} product={product} />\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n// Memoize callbacks passed to children\nfunction Parent() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n    setCount(c => c + 1);\n  }, []);\n\n  return <MemoizedChild onClick={handleClick} />;\n}\n\n// Memoize components\nconst MemoizedChild = React.memo(function Child({ onClick }) {\n  return <button onClick={onClick}>Click me</button>;\n});\n```\n\n## Reference Documentation\n\nFor comprehensive details on React best practices, patterns, and anti-patterns, refer to:\n- `references/react_best_practices.md` - Complete guide covering hooks, component patterns, purity, immutability, custom hooks, and modern React features\n\nLoad this reference when:\n- Implementing complex custom hooks\n- Debugging React-specific issues\n- Reviewing code for anti-patterns\n- Learning advanced patterns like context, reducers, or concurrent features\n- Optimizing performance\n\n## Implementation Checklist\n\nWhen creating or reviewing React components, verify:\n\n- [ ] Component defined at module level (not inside another component)\n- [ ] All hooks called at top level (no conditionals, loops, or early returns before hooks)\n- [ ] Hooks called in consistent order every render\n- [ ] State never mutated directly (always use setState with new values)\n- [ ] Props never mutated\n- [ ] No mutations after values passed to JSX\n- [ ] useEffect includes all dependencies\n- [ ] useEffect returns cleanup function when needed\n- [ ] Event handlers properly defined and named\n- [ ] Keys used correctly in list rendering (stable, unique IDs)\n- [ ] Derived state calculated during render (not in useEffect)\n- [ ] Custom hooks prefixed with \"use\"\n- [ ] Custom hooks follow Rules of Hooks\n- [ ] No hooks passed as props\n- [ ] Component is pure (same props → same output)\n- [ ] Performance optimizations only applied after measuring\n\n## Common Debugging Steps\n\nWhen encountering React issues:\n\n1. **State not updating**: Check for direct mutations, verify setState is called with new values\n2. **Infinite re-renders**: Check useEffect dependencies, verify state updates aren't unconditional\n3. **Stale closures**: Ensure dependencies are complete in useCallback/useMemo/useEffect\n4. **Hook errors**: Verify hooks are at top level, not conditional\n5. **Component not re-rendering**: Check if props/state are actually changing (reference equality)\n6. **Memory leaks**: Ensure useEffect cleanup functions properly cancel subscriptions\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":1,"oldLines":85,"newStart":1,"newLines":555,"lines":[" ---"," name: react-component-creator","-description: [TODO: Complete and informative explanation of what the skill does and when to use it.

Use it when building new React components, refactoring existing code, implementing custom hooks, or optimizing React applications for performance and maintainability.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\nInvoke this skill for:\n- Creating new React functional components from scratch\n- Implementing React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.)\n- Building custom hooks for reusable logic\n- Refactoring class components to functional components\n- Optimizing component performance\n- Managing component state and lifecycle\n- Implementing proper data fetching patterns\n- Following React purity and immutability principles\n- Addressing React-specific bugs or anti-patterns\n\n## Core Principles\n\nBefore implementing any React component, adhere to these fundamental principles:\n\n1. **Components are pure functions** - Same props always produce the same output\n2. **Never mutate props or state** - Always create new objects/arrays\n3. **Hooks follow strict rules** - Top-level only, consistent order, no conditional calls\n4. **Components defined at module level** - Never create components inside other components\n5. **Immutability throughout** - No mutations after values are passed to JSX or hooks\n\n## Component Creation Workflow\n\n### 1. Plan Component Structure\n\nBefore writing code, determine:\n- Is this a presentational or container component?\n- What props does it need?\n- What local state is required?\n- What side effects need to be managed?\n- Are custom hooks needed for reusable logic?\n\n### 2. Write the Component\n\nFollow this template structure for functional components:\n\n```javascript\nimport { useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo } from 'react';\n\nfunction ComponentName({ prop1, prop2 }) {\n  // 1. All hooks at the top level (never conditional)\n  const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);\n  const contextValue = useContext(SomeContext);\n\n  // 2. Derived values and memoization\n  const derivedValue = useMemo(() => {\n    return expensiveComputation(prop1, prop2);\n  }, [prop1, prop2]);\n\n  // 3. Event handlers and callbacks\n  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n    setState(newValue);\n  }, []);\n\n  // 4. Effects (for synchronization only)\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // Setup\n    const subscription = subscribe();\n\n    // Cleanup\n    return () => subscription.unsubscribe();\n  }, [dependencies]);\n\n  // 5. Early returns (after all hooks)\n  if (loading) return <Loading />;\n  if (error) return <Error message={error} />;\n\n  // 6. Render JSX\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>\n        {derivedValue}\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default ComponentName;\n```\n\n### 3. Validate Against Best Practices\n\nCheck the component against these criteria:\n- All hooks are called at the top level\n- No hooks after early returns or in conditionals\n- State is never mutated directly\n- Dependencies in useEffect/useCallback/useMemo are complete","numLines":100,"startLine":1,"totalLines":556}}}

The skill is particularly useful for tasks involving functional components, hooks patterns, custom hooks, and modern React features like concurrent rendering.\n---\n\n# React Component Creator\n\n## Overview\n\nThis skill provides comprehensive guidance for creating high-quality, production-ready React components following modern best practices. Use it when building new React components, refactoring existing code, implementing custom hooks, or optimizing React applications for performance and maintainability.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\nInvoke this skill for:\n- Creating new React functional components from scratch\n- Implementing React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.)\n- Building custom hooks for reusable logic\n- Refactoring class components to functional components\n- Optimizing component performance\n- Managing component state and lifecycle\n- Implementing proper data fetching patterns\n- Following React purity and immutability principles\n- Addressing React-specific bugs or anti-patterns\n\n## Core Principles\n\nBefore implementing any React component, adhere to these fundamental principles:\n\n1. **Components are pure functions** - Same props always produce the same output\n2. **Never mutate props or state** - Always create new objects/arrays\n3. **Hooks follow strict rules** - Top-level only, consistent order, no conditional calls\n4. **Components defined at module level** - Never create components inside other components\n5. **Immutability throughout** - No mutations after values are passed to JSX or hooks\n\n## Component Creation Workflow\n\n### 1. Plan Component Structure\n\nBefore writing code, determine:\n- Is this a presentational or container component?\n- What props does it need?\n- What local state is required?\n- What side effects need to be managed?\n- Are custom hooks needed for reusable logic?\n\n### 2. Write the Component\n\nFollow this template structure for functional components:\n\n```javascript\nimport { useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo } from 'react';\n\nfunction ComponentName({ prop1, prop2 }) {\n  // 1. All hooks at the top level (never conditional)\n  const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);\n  const contextValue = useContext(SomeContext);\n\n  // 2. Derived values and memoization\n  const derivedValue = useMemo(() => {\n    return expensiveComputation(prop1, prop2);\n  }, [prop1, prop2]);\n\n  // 3. Event handlers and callbacks\n  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n    setState(newValue);\n  }, []);\n\n  // 4. Effects (for synchronization only)\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // Setup\n    const subscription = subscribe();\n\n    // Cleanup\n    return () => subscription.unsubscribe();\n  }, [dependencies]);\n\n  // 5. Early returns (after all hooks)\n  if (loading) return <Loading />;\n  if (error) return <Error message={error} />;\n\n  // 6. Render JSX\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>\n        {derivedValue}\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default ComponentName;\n```\n\n### 3. Validate Against Best Practices\n\nCheck the component against these criteria:\n- All hooks are called at the top level\n- No hooks after early returns or in conditionals\n- State is never mutated directly\n- Dependencies in useEffect/useCallback/useMemo are complete\n- Event handlers are properly defined\n- Props are not mutated\n- Component is defined at module level (not inside another component)\n\n### 4. Optimize if Needed\n\nApply optimizations only after measuring performance:\n- Wrap expensive computations in `useMemo`\n- Wrap callback functions in `useCallback` when passed to memoized children\n- Use `React.memo` for components that re-render unnecessarily\n- Consider code splitting for large components\n\n## Common Tasks\n\n### Creating a Form Component\n\n```javascript\nfunction LoginForm() {\n  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');\n  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');\n  const [error, setError] = useState(null);\n  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    setError(null);\n    setIsLoading(true);\n\n    try {\n      await login(email, password);\n    } catch (err) {\n      setError(err.message);\n    } finally {\n      setIsLoading(false);\n    }\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      <input\n        type=\"email\"\n        value={email}\n        onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}\n        disabled={isLoading}\n      />\n      <input\n        type=\"password\"\n        value={password}\n        onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}\n        disabled={isLoading}\n      />\n      {error && <div className=\"error\">{error}</div>}\n      <button type=\"submit\" disabled={isLoading}>\n        {isLoading ? 'Logging in...' : 'Login'}\n      </button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Creating a Custom Hook\n\nExtract reusable logic into custom hooks. Always prefix with \"use\":\n\n```javascript\n// Custom hook for form input management\nfunction useFormInput(initialValue) {\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);\n\n  const handleChange = useCallback((e) => {\n    setValue(e.target.value);\n  }, []);\n\n  const reset = useCallback(() => {\n    setValue(initialValue);\n  }, [initialValue]);\n\n  return {\n    value,\n    onChange: handleChange,\n    reset\n  };\n}\n\n// Usage in component\nfunction RegistrationForm() {\n  const emailInput = useFormInput('');\n  const passwordInput = useFormInput('');\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <input type=\"email\" {...emailInput} />\n      <input type=\"password\" {...passwordInput} />\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Data Fetching Pattern\n\nImplement proper data fetching with cleanup:\n\n```javascript\nfunction useData(url) {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n  const [error, setError] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (!url) return;\n\n    let ignore = false;\n    setLoading(true);\n\n    fetch(url)\n      .then(response => {\n        if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network error');\n        return response.json();\n      })\n      .then(json => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setData(json);\n          setError(null);\n        }\n      })\n      .catch(err => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setError(err.message);\n        }\n      })\n      .finally(() => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setLoading(false);\n        }\n      });\n\n    return () => {\n      ignore = true;\n    };\n  }, [url]);\n\n  return { data, loading, error };\n}\n\n// Usage\nfunction UserProfile({ userId }) {\n  const { data: user, loading, error } = useData(`/api/users/${userId}`);\n\n  if (loading) return <Loading />;\n  if (error) return <Error message={error} />;\n  if (!user) return null;\n\n  return <div>{user.name}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### Context and State Management\n\nImplement context with custom hooks for clean access:\n\n```javascript\n// Create context\nconst UserContext = createContext(null);\nconst UserDispatchContext = createContext(null);\n\n// Custom hooks for context access\nexport function useUser() {\n  const context = useContext(UserContext);\n  if (context === null) {\n    throw new Error('useUser must be used within UserProvider');\n  }\n  return context;\n}\n\nexport function useUserDispatch() {\n  const context = useContext(UserDispatchContext);\n  if (context === null) {\n    throw new Error('useUserDispatch must be used within UserProvider');\n  }\n  return context;\n}\n\n// Provider component\nexport function UserProvider({ children }) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n\n  const login = useCallback((userData) => {\n    setUser(userData);\n  }, []);\n\n  const logout = useCallback(() => {\n    setUser(null);\n  }, []);\n\n  const dispatch = useMemo(() => ({ login, logout }), [login, logout]);\n\n  return (\n    <UserContext.Provider value={user}>\n      <UserDispatchContext.Provider value={dispatch}>\n        {children}\n      </UserDispatchContext.Provider>\n    </UserContext.Provider>\n  );\n}\n\n// Usage in components\nfunction UserMenu() {\n  const user = useUser();\n  const { logout } = useUserDispatch();\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <span>{user.name}</span>\n      <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### List Rendering with Keys\n\nAlways use proper keys for list items:\n\n```javascript\nfunction TodoList({ todos }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {todos.map(todo => (\n        <TodoItem\n          key={todo.id}  // Use stable, unique ID\n          todo={todo}\n        />\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n\n// Managing list state immutably\nfunction TodoApp() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    const newTodo = { id: crypto.randomUUID(), text, completed: false };\n    setTodos([...todos, newTodo]);\n  };\n\n  const toggleTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.map(todo =>\n      todo.id === id ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed } : todo\n    ));\n  };\n\n  const removeTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.filter(todo => todo.id !== id));\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <TodoInput onAdd={addTodo} />\n      <TodoList\n        todos={todos}\n        onToggle={toggleTodo}\n        onRemove={removeTodo}\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Critical Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n### 1. Never Call Hooks Conditionally\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Component({ isLoggedIn }) {\n  if (isLoggedIn) {\n    const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n  }\n  return <div>...</div>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Component({ isLoggedIn }) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n\n  if (!isLoggedIn) return <Login />;\n\n  return <div>{user.name}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Never Mutate State or Props\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction TodoList({ todos }) {\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    todos.push({ text }); // Mutation!\n    setTodos(todos);\n  };\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction TodoList() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    setTodos([...todos, { text }]); // New array\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Never Define Components Inside Components\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Parent() {\n  function Child() {  // Re-created every render!\n    return <div>Child</div>;\n  }\n  return <Child />;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Child() {\n  return <div>Child</div>;\n}\n\nfunction Parent() {\n  return <Child />;\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Never Pass Hooks as Props\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Button({ useData }) {\n  const data = useData(); // Don't pass hooks as props\n  return <button>{data}</button>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Button() {\n  const data = useData(); // Call hooks directly\n  return <button>{data}</button>;\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Don't Use Effect for Derived State\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Component({ firstName, lastName }) {\n  const [fullName, setFullName] = useState('');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    setFullName(`${firstName} ${lastName}`);\n  }, [firstName, lastName]);\n\n  return <div>{fullName}</div>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Component({ firstName, lastName }) {\n  const fullName = `${firstName} ${lastName}`; // Derive during render\n  return <div>{fullName}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\n### Measure Before Optimizing\n\nUse React DevTools Profiler to identify actual performance issues. Don't prematurely optimize.\n\n### Memoization Techniques\n\n```javascript\n// Memoize expensive computations\nfunction ProductList({ products, category }) {\n  const filteredProducts = useMemo(() => {\n    return products.filter(p => p.category === category);\n  }, [products, category]);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {filteredProducts.map(product => (\n        <Product key={product.id} product={product} />\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n// Memoize callbacks passed to children\nfunction Parent() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n    setCount(c => c + 1);\n  }, []);\n\n  return <MemoizedChild onClick={handleClick} />;\n}\n\n// Memoize components\nconst MemoizedChild = React.memo(function Child({ onClick }) {\n  return <button onClick={onClick}>Click me</button>;\n});\n```\n\n## Reference Documentation\n\nFor comprehensive details on React best practices, patterns, and anti-patterns, refer to:\n- `references/react_best_practices.md` - Complete guide covering hooks, component patterns, purity, immutability, custom hooks, and modern React features\n\nLoad this reference when:\n- Implementing complex custom hooks\n- Debugging React-specific issues\n- Reviewing code for anti-patterns\n- Learning advanced patterns like context, reducers, or concurrent features\n- Optimizing performance\n\n## Implementation Checklist\n\nWhen creating or reviewing React components, verify:\n\n- [ ] Component defined at module level (not inside another component)\n- [ ] All hooks called at top level (no conditionals, loops, or early returns before hooks)\n- [ ] Hooks called in consistent order every render\n- [ ] State never mutated directly (always use setState with new values)\n- [ ] Props never mutated\n- [ ] No mutations after values passed to JSX\n- [ ] useEffect includes all dependencies\n- [ ] useEffect returns cleanup function when needed\n- [ ] Event handlers properly defined and named\n- [ ] Keys used correctly in list rendering (stable, unique IDs)\n- [ ] Derived state calculated during render (not in useEffect)\n- [ ] Custom hooks prefixed with \"use\"\n- [ ] Custom hooks follow Rules of Hooks\n- [ ] No hooks passed as props\n- [ ] Component is pure (same props → same output)\n- [ ] Performance optimizations only applied after measuring\n\n## Common Debugging Steps\n\nWhen encountering React issues:\n\n1. **State not updating**: Check for direct mutations, verify setState is called with new values\n2. **Infinite re-renders**: Check useEffect dependencies, verify state updates aren't unconditional\n3. **Stale closures**: Ensure dependencies are complete in useCallback/useMemo/useEffect\n4. **Hook errors**: Verify hooks are at top level, not conditional\n5. **Component not re-rendering**: Check if props/state are actually changing (reference equality)\n6. **Memory leaks**: Ensure useEffect cleanup functions properly cancel subscriptions\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":31,"oldLines":6,"newStart":31,"newLines":8,"lines":[" 3. **Hooks follow strict rules** - Top-level only, consistent order, no conditional calls"," 4. **Components defined at module level** - Never create components inside other components"," 5. **Immutability throughout** - No mutations after values are passed to JSX or hooks","+6. **TypeScript by default** - All components should use TypeScript for type safety","+7. **Server vs Client components** - In Next.js App Router, prefer Server Components by default; use \"use client\" directive only when needed"," "," ## Component Creation Workflow"," "]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

Optimize if Needed\n\nApply optimizations only after measuring performance:\n- Wrap expensive computations in `useMemo`\n- Wrap callback functions in `useCallback` when passed to memoized children\n- Use `React.memo` for components that re-render unnecessarily\n- Consider code splitting for large components\n\n## Common Tasks\n\n### Creating a Form Component\n\n```javascript\nfunction LoginForm() {\n  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');\n  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');\n  const [error, setError] = useState(null);\n  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    setError(null);\n    setIsLoading(true);\n\n    try {\n      await login(email, password);\n    } catch (err) {\n      setError(err.message);\n    } finally {\n      setIsLoading(false);\n    }\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      <input\n        type=\"email\"\n        value={email}\n        onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}\n        disabled={isLoading}\n      />\n      <input\n        type=\"password\"\n        value={password}\n        onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}\n        disabled={isLoading}\n      />\n      {error && <div className=\"error\">{error}</div>}\n      <button type=\"submit\" disabled={isLoading}>\n        {isLoading ? 'Logging in...' : 'Login'}\n      </button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Creating a Custom Hook\n\nExtract reusable logic into custom hooks. Always prefix with \"use\":\n\n```javascript\n// Custom hook for form input management\nfunction useFormInput(initialValue) {\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);\n\n  const handleChange = useCallback((e) => {\n    setValue(e.target.value);\n  }, []);\n\n  const reset = useCallback(() => {\n    setValue(initialValue);\n  }, [initialValue]);\n\n  return {\n    value,\n    onChange: handleChange,\n    reset\n  };\n}\n\n// Usage in component\nfunction RegistrationForm() {\n  const emailInput = useFormInput('');\n  const passwordInput = useFormInput('');\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <input type=\"email\" {...emailInput} />\n      <input type=\"password\" {...passwordInput} />\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Data Fetching Pattern\n\nImplement proper data fetching with cleanup:\n\n```javascript\nfunction useData(url) {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n  const [error, setError] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (!url) return;\n\n    let ignore = false;\n    setLoading(true);\n\n    fetch(url)\n      .then(response => {\n        if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network error');\n        return response.json();\n      })\n      .then(json => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setData(json);\n          setError(null);\n        }\n      })\n      .catch(err => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setError(err.message);\n        }\n      })\n      .finally(() => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setLoading(false);\n        }\n      });\n\n    return () => {\n      ignore = true;\n    };\n  }, [url]);\n\n  return { data, loading, error };\n}\n\n// Usage\nfunction UserProfile({ userId }) {\n  const { data: user, loading, error } = useData(`/api/users/${userId}`);\n\n  if (loading) return <Loading />;\n  if (error) return <Error message={error} />;\n  if (!user) return null;\n\n  return <div>{user.name}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### Context and State Management\n\nImplement context with custom hooks for clean access:\n\n```javascript\n// Create context\nconst UserContext = createContext(null);\nconst UserDispatchContext = createContext(null);\n\n// Custom hooks for context access\nexport function useUser() {\n  const context = useContext(UserContext);\n  if (context === null) {\n    throw new Error('useUser must be used within UserProvider');\n  }\n  return context;\n}\n\nexport function useUserDispatch() {\n  const context = useContext(UserDispatchContext);\n  if (context === null) {\n    throw new Error('useUserDispatch must be used within UserProvider');\n  }\n  return context;\n}\n\n// Provider component\nexport function UserProvider({ children }) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n\n  const login = useCallback((userData) => {\n    setUser(userData);\n  }, []);\n\n  const logout = useCallback(() => {\n    setUser(null);\n  }, []);\n\n  const dispatch = useMemo(() => ({ login, logout }), [login, logout]);\n\n  return (\n    <UserContext.Provider value={user}>\n      <UserDispatchContext.Provider value={dispatch}>\n        {children}\n      </UserDispatchContext.Provider>\n    </UserContext.Provider>\n  );\n}\n\n// Usage in components\nfunction UserMenu() {\n  const user = useUser();\n  const { logout } = useUserDispatch();\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <span>{user.name}</span>\n      <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### List Rendering with Keys\n\nAlways use proper keys for list items:\n\n```javascript\nfunction TodoList({ todos }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {todos.map(todo => (\n        <TodoItem\n          key={todo.id}  // Use stable, unique ID\n          todo={todo}\n        />\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n\n// Managing list state immutably\nfunction TodoApp() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    const newTodo = { id: crypto.randomUUID(), text, completed: false };\n    setTodos([...todos, newTodo]);\n  };\n\n  const toggleTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.map(todo =>\n      todo.id === id ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed } : todo\n    ));\n  };\n\n  const removeTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.filter(todo => todo.id !== id));\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <TodoInput onAdd={addTodo} />\n      <TodoList\n        todos={todos}\n        onToggle={toggleTodo}\n        onRemove={removeTodo}\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Critical Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n### 1. Never Call Hooks Conditionally\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Component({ isLoggedIn }) {\n  if (isLoggedIn) {\n    const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n  }\n  return <div>...</div>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Component({ isLoggedIn }) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n\n  if (!isLoggedIn) return <Login />;\n\n  return <div>{user.name}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Never Mutate State or Props\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction TodoList({ todos }) {\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    todos.push({ text }); // Mutation!\n    setTodos(todos);\n  };\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction TodoList() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    setTodos([...todos, { text }]); // New array\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Never Define Components Inside Components\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Parent() {\n  function Child() {  // Re-created every render!\n    return <div>Child</div>;\n  }\n  return <Child />;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Child() {\n  return <div>Child</div>;\n}\n\nfunction Parent() {\n  return <Child />;\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Never Pass Hooks as Props\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Button({ useData }) {\n  const data = useData(); // Don't pass hooks as props\n  return <button>{data}</button>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Button() {\n  const data = useData(); // Call hooks directly\n  return <button>{data}</button>;\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Don't Use Effect for Derived State\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Component({ firstName, lastName }) {\n  const [fullName, setFullName] = useState('');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    setFullName(`${firstName} ${lastName}`);\n  }, [firstName, lastName]);\n\n  return <div>{fullName}</div>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Component({ firstName, lastName }) {\n  const fullName = `${firstName} ${lastName}`; // Derive during render\n  return <div>{fullName}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\n### Measure Before Optimizing\n\nUse React DevTools Profiler to identify actual performance issues. Don't prematurely optimize.\n\n### Memoization Techniques\n\n```javascript\n// Memoize expensive computations\nfunction ProductList({ products, category }) {\n  const filteredProducts = useMemo(() => {\n    return products.filter(p => p.category === category);\n  }, [products, category]);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {filteredProducts.map(product => (\n        <Product key={product.id} product={product} />\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n// Memoize callbacks passed to children\nfunction Parent() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n    setCount(c => c + 1);\n  }, []);\n\n  return <MemoizedChild onClick={handleClick} />;\n}\n\n// Memoize components\nconst MemoizedChild = React.memo(function Child({ onClick }) {\n  return <button onClick={onClick}>Click me</button>;\n});\n```\n\n## Reference Documentation\n\nFor comprehensive details on React best practices, patterns, and anti-patterns, refer to:\n- `references/react_best_practices.md` - Complete guide covering hooks, component patterns, purity, immutability, custom hooks, and modern React features\n\nLoad this reference when:\n- Implementing complex custom hooks\n- Debugging React-specific issues\n- Reviewing code for anti-patterns\n- Learning advanced patterns like context, reducers, or concurrent features\n- Optimizing performance\n\n## Implementation Checklist\n\nWhen creating or reviewing React components, verify:\n\n- [ ] Component defined at module level (not inside another component)\n- [ ] All hooks called at top level (no conditionals, loops, or early returns before hooks)\n- [ ] Hooks called in consistent order every render\n- [ ] State never mutated directly (always use setState with new values)\n- [ ] Props never mutated\n- [ ] No mutations after values passed to JSX\n- [ ] useEffect includes all dependencies\n- [ ] useEffect returns cleanup function when needed\n- [ ] Event handlers properly defined and named\n- [ ] Keys used correctly in list rendering (stable, unique IDs)\n- [ ] Derived state calculated during render (not in useEffect)\n- [ ] Custom hooks prefixed with \"use\"\n- [ ] Custom hooks follow Rules of Hooks\n- [ ] No hooks passed as props\n- [ ] Component is pure (same props → same output)\n- [ ] Performance optimizations only applied after measuring\n\n## Common Debugging Steps\n\nWhen encountering React issues:\n\n1. **State not updating**: Check for direct mutations, verify setState is called with new values\n2. **Infinite re-renders**: Check useEffect dependencies, verify state updates aren't unconditional\n3. **Stale closures**: Ensure dependencies are complete in useCallback/useMemo/useEffect\n4. **Hook errors**: Verify hooks are at top level, not conditional\n5. **Component not re-rendering**: Check if props/state are actually changing (reference equality)\n6. **Memory leaks**: Ensure useEffect cleanup functions properly cancel subscriptions\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":39,"oldLines":11,"newStart":39,"newLines":13,"lines":[" ### 1.

Use it when building new React components, refactoring existing code, implementing custom hooks, or optimizing React applications for performance and maintainability.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\nInvoke this skill for:\n- Creating new React functional components from scratch\n- Implementing React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.)\n- Building custom hooks for reusable logic\n- Refactoring class components to functional components\n- Optimizing component performance\n- Managing component state and lifecycle\n- Implementing proper data fetching patterns\n- Following React purity and immutability principles\n- Addressing React-specific bugs or anti-patterns\n\n## Core Principles\n\nBefore implementing any React component, adhere to these fundamental principles:\n\n1. **Components are pure functions** - Same props always produce the same output\n2. **Never mutate props or state** - Always create new objects/arrays\n3. **Hooks follow strict rules** - Top-level only, consistent order, no conditional calls\n4. **Components defined at module level** - Never create components inside other components\n5. **Immutability throughout** - No mutations after values are passed to JSX or hooks\n6. **TypeScript by default** - All components should use TypeScript for type safety\n7. **Server vs Client components** - In Next.js App Router, prefer Server Components by default; use \"use client\" directive only when needed\n\n## Component Creation Workflow\n\n### 1. Plan Component Structure\n\nBefore writing code, determine:\n- Is this a Server Component or Client Component? (Next.js App Router)\n- Is this a presentational or container component?\n- What props does it need? (Define TypeScript interface)\n- What local state is required?\n- What side effects need to be managed?\n- Are custom hooks needed for reusable logic?\n- Does it need error boundaries?\n\n### 2. Write the Component\n\nFollow this template structure for functional components:\n\n```javascript\nimport { useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo } from 'react';\n\nfunction ComponentName({ prop1, prop2 }) {\n  // 1. All hooks at the top level (never conditional)\n  const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);\n  const contextValue = useContext(SomeContext);\n\n  // 2. Derived values and memoization\n  const derivedValue = useMemo(() => {\n    return expensiveComputation(prop1, prop2);\n  }, [prop1, prop2]);\n\n  // 3. Event handlers and callbacks\n  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n    setState(newValue);\n  }, []);\n\n  // 4. Effects (for synchronization only)\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // Setup\n    const subscription = subscribe();\n\n    // Cleanup\n    return () => subscription.unsubscribe();\n  }, [dependencies]);\n\n  // 5. Early returns (after all hooks)\n  if (loading) return <Loading />;\n  if (error) return <Error message={error} />;\n\n  // 6. Render JSX\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>\n        {derivedValue}\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default ComponentName;\n```\n\n### 3. Validate Against Best Practices\n\nCheck the component against these criteria:\n- All hooks are called at the top level\n- No hooks after early returns or in conditionals\n- State is never mutated directly\n- Dependencies in useEffect/useCallback/useMemo are complete\n- Event handlers are properly defined\n- Props are not mutated\n- Component is defined at module level (not inside another component)\n\n### 4. Optimize if Needed\n\nApply optimizations only after measuring performance:\n- Wrap expensive computations in `useMemo`\n- Wrap callback functions in `useCallback` when passed to memoized children\n- Use `React.memo` for components that re-render unnecessarily\n- Consider code splitting for large components\n\n## Common Tasks\n\n### Creating a Form Component\n\n```javascript\nfunction LoginForm() {\n  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');\n  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');\n  const [error, setError] = useState(null);\n  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    setError(null);\n    setIsLoading(true);\n\n    try {\n      await login(email, password);\n    } catch (err) {\n      setError(err.message);\n    } finally {\n      setIsLoading(false);\n    }\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      <input\n        type=\"email\"\n        value={email}\n        onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}\n        disabled={isLoading}\n      />\n      <input\n        type=\"password\"\n        value={password}\n        onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}\n        disabled={isLoading}\n      />\n      {error && <div className=\"error\">{error}</div>}\n      <button type=\"submit\" disabled={isLoading}>\n        {isLoading ? 'Logging in...' : 'Login'}\n      </button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Creating a Custom Hook\n\nExtract reusable logic into custom hooks. Always prefix with \"use\":\n\n```javascript\n// Custom hook for form input management\nfunction useFormInput(initialValue) {\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);\n\n  const handleChange = useCallback((e) => {\n    setValue(e.target.value);\n  }, []);\n\n  const reset = useCallback(() => {\n    setValue(initialValue);\n  }, [initialValue]);\n\n  return {\n    value,\n    onChange: handleChange,\n    reset\n  };\n}\n\n// Usage in component\nfunction RegistrationForm() {\n  const emailInput = useFormInput('');\n  const passwordInput = useFormInput('');\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <input type=\"email\" {...emailInput} />\n      <input type=\"password\" {...passwordInput} />\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Data Fetching Pattern\n\nImplement proper data fetching with cleanup:\n\n```javascript\nfunction useData(url) {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n  const [error, setError] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (!url) return;\n\n    let ignore = false;\n    setLoading(true);\n\n    fetch(url)\n      .then(response => {\n        if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network error');\n        return response.json();\n      })\n      .then(json => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setData(json);\n          setError(null);\n        }\n      })\n      .catch(err => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setError(err.message);\n        }\n      })\n      .finally(() => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setLoading(false);\n        }\n      });\n\n    return () => {\n      ignore = true;\n    };\n  }, [url]);\n\n  return { data, loading, error };\n}\n\n// Usage\nfunction UserProfile({ userId }) {\n  const { data: user, loading, error } = useData(`/api/users/${userId}`);\n\n  if (loading) return <Loading />;\n  if (error) return <Error message={error} />;\n  if (!user) return null;\n\n  return <div>{user.name}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### Context and State Management\n\nImplement context with custom hooks for clean access:\n\n```javascript\n// Create context\nconst UserContext = createContext(null);\nconst UserDispatchContext = createContext(null);\n\n// Custom hooks for context access\nexport function useUser() {\n  const context = useContext(UserContext);\n  if (context === null) {\n    throw new Error('useUser must be used within UserProvider');\n  }\n  return context;\n}\n\nexport function useUserDispatch() {\n  const context = useContext(UserDispatchContext);\n  if (context === null) {\n    throw new Error('useUserDispatch must be used within UserProvider');\n  }\n  return context;\n}\n\n// Provider component\nexport function UserProvider({ children }) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n\n  const login = useCallback((userData) => {\n    setUser(userData);\n  }, []);\n\n  const logout = useCallback(() => {\n    setUser(null);\n  }, []);\n\n  const dispatch = useMemo(() => ({ login, logout }), [login, logout]);\n\n  return (\n    <UserContext.Provider value={user}>\n      <UserDispatchContext.Provider value={dispatch}>\n        {children}\n      </UserDispatchContext.Provider>\n    </UserContext.Provider>\n  );\n}\n\n// Usage in components\nfunction UserMenu() {\n  const user = useUser();\n  const { logout } = useUserDispatch();\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <span>{user.name}</span>\n      <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### List Rendering with Keys\n\nAlways use proper keys for list items:\n\n```javascript\nfunction TodoList({ todos }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {todos.map(todo => (\n        <TodoItem\n          key={todo.id}  // Use stable, unique ID\n          todo={todo}\n        />\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n\n// Managing list state immutably\nfunction TodoApp() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    const newTodo = { id: crypto.randomUUID(), text, completed: false };\n    setTodos([...todos, newTodo]);\n  };\n\n  const toggleTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.map(todo =>\n      todo.id === id ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed } : todo\n    ));\n  };\n\n  const removeTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.filter(todo => todo.id !== id));\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <TodoInput onAdd={addTodo} />\n      <TodoList\n        todos={todos}\n        onToggle={toggleTodo}\n        onRemove={removeTodo}\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Critical Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n### 1. Never Call Hooks Conditionally\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Component({ isLoggedIn }) {\n  if (isLoggedIn) {\n    const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n  }\n  return <div>...</div>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Component({ isLoggedIn }) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n\n  if (!isLoggedIn) return <Login />;\n\n  return <div>{user.name}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Never Mutate State or Props\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction TodoList({ todos }) {\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    todos.push({ text }); // Mutation!\n    setTodos(todos);\n  };\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction TodoList() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    setTodos([...todos, { text }]); // New array\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Never Define Components Inside Components\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Parent() {\n  function Child() {  // Re-created every render!\n    return <div>Child</div>;\n  }\n  return <Child />;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Child() {\n  return <div>Child</div>;\n}\n\nfunction Parent() {\n  return <Child />;\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Never Pass Hooks as Props\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Button({ useData }) {\n  const data = useData(); // Don't pass hooks as props\n  return <button>{data}</button>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Button() {\n  const data = useData(); // Call hooks directly\n  return <button>{data}</button>;\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Don't Use Effect for Derived State\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Component({ firstName, lastName }) {\n  const [fullName, setFullName] = useState('');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    setFullName(`${firstName} ${lastName}`);\n  }, [firstName, lastName]);\n\n  return <div>{fullName}</div>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Component({ firstName, lastName }) {\n  const fullName = `${firstName} ${lastName}`; // Derive during render\n  return <div>{fullName}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\n### Measure Before Optimizing\n\nUse React DevTools Profiler to identify actual performance issues. Don't prematurely optimize.\n\n### Memoization Techniques\n\n```javascript\n// Memoize expensive computations\nfunction ProductList({ products, category }) {\n  const filteredProducts = useMemo(() => {\n    return products.filter(p => p.category === category);\n  }, [products, category]);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {filteredProducts.map(product => (\n        <Product key={product.id} product={product} />\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n// Memoize callbacks passed to children\nfunction Parent() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n    setCount(c => c + 1);\n  }, []);\n\n  return <MemoizedChild onClick={handleClick} />;\n}\n\n// Memoize components\nconst MemoizedChild = React.memo(function Child({ onClick }) {\n  return <button onClick={onClick}>Click me</button>;\n});\n```\n\n## Reference Documentation\n\nFor comprehensive details on React best practices, patterns, and anti-patterns, refer to:\n- `references/react_best_practices.md` - Complete guide covering hooks, component patterns, purity, immutability, custom hooks, and modern React features\n\nLoad this reference when:\n- Implementing complex custom hooks\n- Debugging React-specific issues\n- Reviewing code for anti-patterns\n- Learning advanced patterns like context, reducers, or concurrent features\n- Optimizing performance\n\n## Implementation Checklist\n\nWhen creating or reviewing React components, verify:\n\n- [ ] Component defined at module level (not inside another component)\n- [ ] All hooks called at top level (no conditionals, loops, or early returns before hooks)\n- [ ] Hooks called in consistent order every render\n- [ ] State never mutated directly (always use setState with new values)\n- [ ] Props never mutated\n- [ ] No mutations after values passed to JSX\n- [ ] useEffect includes all dependencies\n- [ ] useEffect returns cleanup function when needed\n- [ ] Event handlers properly defined and named\n- [ ] Keys used correctly in list rendering (stable, unique IDs)\n- [ ] Derived state calculated during render (not in useEffect)\n- [ ] Custom hooks prefixed with \"use\"\n- [ ] Custom hooks follow Rules of Hooks\n- [ ] No hooks passed as props\n- [ ] Component is pure (same props → same output)\n- [ ] Performance optimizations only applied after measuring\n\n## Common Debugging Steps\n\nWhen encountering React issues:\n\n1. **State not updating**: Check for direct mutations, verify setState is called with new values\n2. **Infinite re-renders**: Check useEffect dependencies, verify state updates aren't unconditional\n3. **Stale closures**: Ensure dependencies are complete in useCallback/useMemo/useEffect\n4. **Hook errors**: Verify hooks are at top level, not conditional\n5. **Component not re-rendering**: Check if props/state are actually changing (reference equality)\n6. **Memory leaks**: Ensure useEffect cleanup functions properly cancel subscriptions\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":51,"oldLines":12,"newStart":51,"newLines":21,"lines":[" "," Follow this template structure for functional components:"," ","-```javascript","+#### Client Component (TypeScript)","+","+```typescript","+'use client'; // Only if component uses hooks, browser APIs, or event handlers","+"," import { useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo } from 'react';"," ","-function ComponentName({ prop1, prop2 }) {","+interface ComponentNameProps {","+  prop1: string;","+  prop2: number;","+}","+","+export function ComponentName({ prop1, prop2 }: ComponentNameProps) {","   // 1.

This includes writing new React components, refactoring existing code, implementing React hooks, managing state, handling component lifecycle, optimizing performance, and following modern React best practices. The skill is particularly useful for tasks involving functional components, hooks patterns, custom hooks, and modern React features like concurrent rendering.\n---\n\n# React Component Creator\n\n## Overview\n\nThis skill provides comprehensive guidance for creating high-quality, production-ready React components following modern best practices. Use it when building new React components, refactoring existing code, implementing custom hooks, or optimizing React applications for performance and maintainability.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\nInvoke this skill for:\n- Creating new React functional components from scratch\n- Implementing React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.)\n- Building custom hooks for reusable logic\n- Refactoring class components to functional components\n- Optimizing component performance\n- Managing component state and lifecycle\n- Implementing proper data fetching patterns\n- Following React purity and immutability principles\n- Addressing React-specific bugs or anti-patterns\n\n## Core Principles\n\nBefore implementing any React component, adhere to these fundamental principles:\n\n1. **Components are pure functions** - Same props always produce the same output\n2. **Never mutate props or state** - Always create new objects/arrays\n3. **Hooks follow strict rules** - Top-level only, consistent order, no conditional calls\n4. **Components defined at module level** - Never create components inside other components\n5. **Immutability throughout** - No mutations after values are passed to JSX or hooks\n6. **TypeScript by default** - All components should use TypeScript for type safety\n7. **Server vs Client components** - In Next.js App Router, prefer Server Components by default; use \"use client\" directive only when needed\n\n## Component Creation Workflow\n\n### 1. Plan Component Structure\n\nBefore writing code, determine:\n- Is this a Server Component or Client Component? (Next.js App Router)\n- Is this a presentational or container component?\n- What props does it need? (Define TypeScript interface)\n- What local state is required?\n- What side effects need to be managed?\n- Are custom hooks needed for reusable logic?\n- Does it need error boundaries?\n\n### 2. Write the Component\n\nFollow this template structure for functional components:\n\n#### Client Component (TypeScript)\n\n```typescript\n'use client'; // Only if component uses hooks, browser APIs, or event handlers\n\nimport { useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo } from 'react';\n\ninterface ComponentNameProps {\n  prop1: string;\n  prop2: number;\n}\n\nexport function ComponentName({ prop1, prop2 }: ComponentNameProps) {\n  // 1. All hooks at the top level (never conditional)\n  const [state, setState] = useState<string>(initialValue);\n  const contextValue = useContext(SomeContext);\n\n  // 2. Derived values and memoization\n  const derivedValue = useMemo(() => {\n    return expensiveComputation(prop1, prop2);\n  }, [prop1, prop2]);\n\n  // 3. Event handlers and callbacks\n  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n    setState(newValue);\n  }, []);\n\n  // 4. Effects (for synchronization only)\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // Setup\n    const subscription = subscribe();\n\n    // Cleanup\n    return () => subscription.unsubscribe();\n  }, [dependencies]);\n\n  // 5. Early returns (after all hooks)\n  if (loading) return <Loading />;\n  if (error) return <Error message={error} />;\n\n  // 6. Render JSX\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>\n        {derivedValue}\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### Server Component (TypeScript - Next.js App Router)\n\n```typescript\n// No 'use client' directive - Server Component by default\n\ninterface UserProfileProps {\n  userId: string;\n}\n\nexport async function UserProfile({ userId }: UserProfileProps) {\n  // Server Components can be async and fetch data directly\n  const user = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`)\n    .then(res => res.json());\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{user.name}</h1>\n      <p>{user.email}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Validate Against Best Practices\n\nCheck the component against these criteria:\n- All hooks are called at the top level\n- No hooks after early returns or in conditionals\n- State is never mutated directly\n- Dependencies in useEffect/useCallback/useMemo are complete\n- Event handlers are properly defined\n- Props are not mutated\n- Component is defined at module level (not inside another component)\n\n### 4. Optimize if Needed\n\nApply optimizations only after measuring performance:\n- Wrap expensive computations in `useMemo`\n- Wrap callback functions in `useCallback` when passed to memoized children\n- Use `React.memo` for components that re-render unnecessarily\n- Consider code splitting for large components\n\n## Common Tasks\n\n### Creating a Form Component\n\n```javascript\nfunction LoginForm() {\n  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');\n  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');\n  const [error, setError] = useState(null);\n  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    setError(null);\n    setIsLoading(true);\n\n    try {\n      await login(email, password);\n    } catch (err) {\n      setError(err.message);\n    } finally {\n      setIsLoading(false);\n    }\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      <input\n        type=\"email\"\n        value={email}\n        onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}\n        disabled={isLoading}\n      />\n      <input\n        type=\"password\"\n        value={password}\n        onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}\n        disabled={isLoading}\n      />\n      {error && <div className=\"error\">{error}</div>}\n      <button type=\"submit\" disabled={isLoading}>\n        {isLoading ? 'Logging in...' : 'Login'}\n      </button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Creating a Custom Hook\n\nExtract reusable logic into custom hooks. Always prefix with \"use\":\n\n```javascript\n// Custom hook for form input management\nfunction useFormInput(initialValue) {\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);\n\n  const handleChange = useCallback((e) => {\n    setValue(e.target.value);\n  }, []);\n\n  const reset = useCallback(() => {\n    setValue(initialValue);\n  }, [initialValue]);\n\n  return {\n    value,\n    onChange: handleChange,\n    reset\n  };\n}\n\n// Usage in component\nfunction RegistrationForm() {\n  const emailInput = useFormInput('');\n  const passwordInput = useFormInput('');\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <input type=\"email\" {...emailInput} />\n      <input type=\"password\" {...passwordInput} />\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Data Fetching Pattern\n\nImplement proper data fetching with cleanup:\n\n```javascript\nfunction useData(url) {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n  const [error, setError] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (!url) return;\n\n    let ignore = false;\n    setLoading(true);\n\n    fetch(url)\n      .then(response => {\n        if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network error');\n        return response.json();\n      })\n      .then(json => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setData(json);\n          setError(null);\n        }\n      })\n      .catch(err => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setError(err.message);\n        }\n      })\n      .finally(() => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setLoading(false);\n        }\n      });\n\n    return () => {\n      ignore = true;\n    };\n  }, [url]);\n\n  return { data, loading, error };\n}\n\n// Usage\nfunction UserProfile({ userId }) {\n  const { data: user, loading, error } = useData(`/api/users/${userId}`);\n\n  if (loading) return <Loading />;\n  if (error) return <Error message={error} />;\n  if (!user) return null;\n\n  return <div>{user.name}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### Context and State Management\n\nImplement context with custom hooks for clean access:\n\n```javascript\n// Create context\nconst UserContext = createContext(null);\nconst UserDispatchContext = createContext(null);\n\n// Custom hooks for context access\nexport function useUser() {\n  const context = useContext(UserContext);\n  if (context === null) {\n    throw new Error('useUser must be used within UserProvider');\n  }\n  return context;\n}\n\nexport function useUserDispatch() {\n  const context = useContext(UserDispatchContext);\n  if (context === null) {\n    throw new Error('useUserDispatch must be used within UserProvider');\n  }\n  return context;\n}\n\n// Provider component\nexport function UserProvider({ children }) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n\n  const login = useCallback((userData) => {\n    setUser(userData);\n  }, []);\n\n  const logout = useCallback(() => {\n    setUser(null);\n  }, []);\n\n  const dispatch = useMemo(() => ({ login, logout }), [login, logout]);\n\n  return (\n    <UserContext.Provider value={user}>\n      <UserDispatchContext.Provider value={dispatch}>\n        {children}\n      </UserDispatchContext.Provider>\n    </UserContext.Provider>\n  );\n}\n\n// Usage in components\nfunction UserMenu() {\n  const user = useUser();\n  const { logout } = useUserDispatch();\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <span>{user.name}</span>\n      <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### List Rendering with Keys\n\nAlways use proper keys for list items:\n\n```javascript\nfunction TodoList({ todos }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {todos.map(todo => (\n        <TodoItem\n          key={todo.id}  // Use stable, unique ID\n          todo={todo}\n        />\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n\n// Managing list state immutably\nfunction TodoApp() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    const newTodo = { id: crypto.randomUUID(), text, completed: false };\n    setTodos([...todos, newTodo]);\n  };\n\n  const toggleTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.map(todo =>\n      todo.id === id ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed } : todo\n    ));\n  };\n\n  const removeTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.filter(todo => todo.id !== id));\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <TodoInput onAdd={addTodo} />\n      <TodoList\n        todos={todos}\n        onToggle={toggleTodo}\n        onRemove={removeTodo}\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Critical Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n### 1. Never Call Hooks Conditionally\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Component({ isLoggedIn }) {\n  if (isLoggedIn) {\n    const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n  }\n  return <div>...</div>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Component({ isLoggedIn }) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n\n  if (!isLoggedIn) return <Login />;\n\n  return <div>{user.name}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Never Mutate State or Props\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction TodoList({ todos }) {\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    todos.push({ text }); // Mutation!\n    setTodos(todos);\n  };\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction TodoList() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    setTodos([...todos, { text }]); // New array\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Never Define Components Inside Components\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Parent() {\n  function Child() {  // Re-created every render!\n    return <div>Child</div>;\n  }\n  return <Child />;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Child() {\n  return <div>Child</div>;\n}\n\nfunction Parent() {\n  return <Child />;\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Never Pass Hooks as Props\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Button({ useData }) {\n  const data = useData(); // Don't pass hooks as props\n  return <button>{data}</button>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Button() {\n  const data = useData(); // Call hooks directly\n  return <button>{data}</button>;\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Don't Use Effect for Derived State\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Component({ firstName, lastName }) {\n  const [fullName, setFullName] = useState('');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    setFullName(`${firstName} ${lastName}`);\n  }, [firstName, lastName]);\n\n  return <div>{fullName}</div>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Component({ firstName, lastName }) {\n  const fullName = `${firstName} ${lastName}`; // Derive during render\n  return <div>{fullName}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\n### Measure Before Optimizing\n\nUse React DevTools Profiler to identify actual performance issues. Don't prematurely optimize.\n\n### Memoization Techniques\n\n```javascript\n// Memoize expensive computations\nfunction ProductList({ products, category }) {\n  const filteredProducts = useMemo(() => {\n    return products.filter(p => p.category === category);\n  }, [products, category]);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {filteredProducts.map(product => (\n        <Product key={product.id} product={product} />\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n// Memoize callbacks passed to children\nfunction Parent() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n    setCount(c => c + 1);\n  }, []);\n\n  return <MemoizedChild onClick={handleClick} />;\n}\n\n// Memoize components\nconst MemoizedChild = React.memo(function Child({ onClick }) {\n  return <button onClick={onClick}>Click me</button>;\n});\n```\n\n## Reference Documentation\n\nFor comprehensive details on React best practices, patterns, and anti-patterns, refer to:\n- `references/react_best_practices.md` - Complete guide covering hooks, component patterns, purity, immutability, custom hooks, and modern React features\n\nLoad this reference when:\n- Implementing complex custom hooks\n- Debugging React-specific issues\n- Reviewing code for anti-patterns\n- Learning advanced patterns like context, reducers, or concurrent features\n- Optimizing performance\n\n## Implementation Checklist\n\nWhen creating or reviewing React components, verify:\n\n- [ ] Component defined at module level (not inside another component)\n- [ ] All hooks called at top level (no conditionals, loops, or early returns before hooks)\n- [ ] Hooks called in consistent order every render\n- [ ] State never mutated directly (always use setState with new values)\n- [ ] Props never mutated\n- [ ] No mutations after values passed to JSX\n- [ ] useEffect includes all dependencies\n- [ ] useEffect returns cleanup function when needed\n- [ ] Event handlers properly defined and named\n- [ ] Keys used correctly in list rendering (stable, unique IDs)\n- [ ] Derived state calculated during render (not in useEffect)\n- [ ] Custom hooks prefixed with \"use\"\n- [ ] Custom hooks follow Rules of Hooks\n- [ ] No hooks passed as props\n- [ ] Component is pure (same props → same output)\n- [ ] Performance optimizations only applied after measuring\n\n## Common Debugging Steps\n\nWhen encountering React issues:\n\n1. **State not updating**: Check for direct mutations, verify setState is called with new values\n2. **Infinite re-renders**: Check useEffect dependencies, verify state updates aren't unconditional\n3. **Stale closures**: Ensure dependencies are complete in useCallback/useMemo/useEffect\n4. **Hook errors**: Verify hooks are at top level, not conditional\n5. **Component not re-rendering**: Check if props/state are actually changing (reference equality)\n6. **Memory leaks**: Ensure useEffect cleanup functions properly cancel subscriptions\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":144,"oldLines":26,"newStart":144,"newLines":99,"lines":[" - Use `React.memo` for components that re-render unnecessarily"," - Consider code splitting for large components"," ","+## Next.js App Router Specifics","+","+### Server vs Client Components","+","+**Server Components (Default):**","+- No \"use client\" directive needed","+- Can be async functions","+- Can fetch data directly with await","+- Rendered on the server","+- Cannot use hooks, event handlers, or browser APIs","+- Smaller JavaScript bundle","+","+**Client Components:**","+- Require \"use client\" directive at the top of the file","+- Can use hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)","+- Can use event handlers (onClick, onChange, etc.)","+- Can access browser APIs (window, localStorage, etc.)","+- Rendered on both server (initial) and client (hydration)","+","+```typescript","+// Server Component - prefer by default","+export async function BlogPost({ slug }: { slug: string }) {","+  const post = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/posts/${slug}`)","+    .then(res => res.json());","+","+  return <article>{post.content}</article>;","+}","+","+// Client Component - only when needed","+'use client';","+","+export function LikeButton({ postId }: { postId: string }) {","+  const [liked, setLiked] = useState(false);","+","+  return (","+    <button onClick={() => setLiked(!liked)}>","+      {liked ?

This includes writing new React components, refactoring existing code, implementing React hooks, managing state, handling component lifecycle, optimizing performance, and following modern React best practices. The skill is particularly useful for tasks involving functional components, hooks patterns, custom hooks, and modern React features like concurrent rendering.\n---\n\n# React Component Creator\n\n## Overview\n\nThis skill provides comprehensive guidance for creating high-quality, production-ready React components following modern best practices. Use it when building new React components, refactoring existing code, implementing custom hooks, or optimizing React applications for performance and maintainability.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\nInvoke this skill for:\n- Creating new React functional components from scratch\n- Implementing React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.)\n- Building custom hooks for reusable logic\n- Refactoring class components to functional components\n- Optimizing component performance\n- Managing component state and lifecycle\n- Implementing proper data fetching patterns\n- Following React purity and immutability principles\n- Addressing React-specific bugs or anti-patterns\n\n## Core Principles\n\nBefore implementing any React component, adhere to these fundamental principles:\n\n1. **Components are pure functions** - Same props always produce the same output\n2. **Never mutate props or state** - Always create new objects/arrays\n3. **Hooks follow strict rules** - Top-level only, consistent order, no conditional calls\n4. **Components defined at module level** - Never create components inside other components\n5. **Immutability throughout** - No mutations after values are passed to JSX or hooks\n6. **TypeScript by default** - All components should use TypeScript for type safety\n7. **Server vs Client components** - In Next.js App Router, prefer Server Components by default; use \"use client\" directive only when needed\n\n## Component Creation Workflow\n\n### 1. Plan Component Structure\n\nBefore writing code, determine:\n- Is this a Server Component or Client Component? (Next.js App Router)\n- Is this a presentational or container component?\n- What props does it need? (Define TypeScript interface)\n- What local state is required?\n- What side effects need to be managed?\n- Are custom hooks needed for reusable logic?\n- Does it need error boundaries?\n\n### 2. Write the Component\n\nFollow this template structure for functional components:\n\n#### Client Component (TypeScript)\n\n```typescript\n'use client'; // Only if component uses hooks, browser APIs, or event handlers\n\nimport { useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo } from 'react';\n\ninterface ComponentNameProps {\n  prop1: string;\n  prop2: number;\n}\n\nexport function ComponentName({ prop1, prop2 }: ComponentNameProps) {\n  // 1. All hooks at the top level (never conditional)\n  const [state, setState] = useState<string>(initialValue);\n  const contextValue = useContext(SomeContext);\n\n  // 2. Derived values and memoization\n  const derivedValue = useMemo(() => {\n    return expensiveComputation(prop1, prop2);\n  }, [prop1, prop2]);\n\n  // 3. Event handlers and callbacks\n  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n    setState(newValue);\n  }, []);\n\n  // 4. Effects (for synchronization only)\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // Setup\n    const subscription = subscribe();\n\n    // Cleanup\n    return () => subscription.unsubscribe();\n  }, [dependencies]);\n\n  // 5. Early returns (after all hooks)\n  if (loading) return <Loading />;\n  if (error) return <Error message={error} />;\n\n  // 6. Render JSX\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>\n        {derivedValue}\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### Server Component (TypeScript - Next.js App Router)\n\n```typescript\n// No 'use client' directive - Server Component by default\n\ninterface UserProfileProps {\n  userId: string;\n}\n\nexport async function UserProfile({ userId }: UserProfileProps) {\n  // Server Components can be async and fetch data directly\n  const user = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`)\n    .then(res => res.json());\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{user.name}</h1>\n      <p>{user.email}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Validate Against Best Practices\n\nCheck the component against these criteria:\n- All hooks are called at the top level\n- No hooks after early returns or in conditionals\n- State is never mutated directly\n- Dependencies in useEffect/useCallback/useMemo are complete\n- Event handlers are properly defined\n- Props are not mutated\n- Component is defined at module level (not inside another component)\n\n### 4. Optimize if Needed\n\nApply optimizations only after measuring performance:\n- Wrap expensive computations in `useMemo`\n- Wrap callback functions in `useCallback` when passed to memoized children\n- Use `React.memo` for components that re-render unnecessarily\n- Consider code splitting for large components\n\n## Next.js App Router Specifics\n\n### Server vs Client Components\n\n**Server Components (Default):**\n- No \"use client\" directive needed\n- Can be async functions\n- Can fetch data directly with await\n- Rendered on the server\n- Cannot use hooks, event handlers, or browser APIs\n- Smaller JavaScript bundle\n\n**Client Components:**\n- Require \"use client\" directive at the top of the file\n- Can use hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)\n- Can use event handlers (onClick, onChange, etc.)\n- Can access browser APIs (window, localStorage, etc.)\n- Rendered on both server (initial) and client (hydration)\n\n```typescript\n// Server Component - prefer by default\nexport async function BlogPost({ slug }: { slug: string }) {\n  const post = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/posts/${slug}`)\n    .then(res => res.json());\n\n  return <article>{post.content}</article>;\n}\n\n// Client Component - only when needed\n'use client';\n\nexport function LikeButton({ postId }: { postId: string }) {\n  const [liked, setLiked] = useState(false);\n\n  return (\n    <button onClick={() => setLiked(!liked)}>\n      {liked ? '❤️' : '🤍'}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Composition Pattern\n\nCombine Server and Client Components effectively:\n\n```typescript\n// app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx (Server Component)\nimport { LikeButton } from '@/components/LikeButton';\n\nexport default async function BlogPage({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {\n  const post = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/posts/${params.slug}`)\n    .then(res => res.json());\n\n  return (\n    <article>\n      <h1>{post.title}</h1>\n      <div>{post.content}</div>\n      <LikeButton postId={post.id} /> {/* Client Component */}\n    </article>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Common Tasks\n\n### Creating a Form Component (TypeScript)\n\n```typescript\n'use client';\n\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\ninterface LoginFormProps {\n  onSuccess?: () => void;\n}\n\nexport function LoginForm({ onSuccess }: LoginFormProps) {\n  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');\n  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');\n  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);\n  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    setError(null);\n    setIsLoading(true);\n\n    try {\n      await login(email, password);\n      onSuccess?.();\n    } catch (err) {\n      setError(err instanceof Error ? err.message : 'Login failed');\n    } finally {\n      setIsLoading(false);\n    }\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      <input\n        type=\"email\"\n        value={email}\n        onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}\n        disabled={isLoading}\n        required\n      />\n      <input\n        type=\"password\"\n        value={password}\n        onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}\n        disabled={isLoading}\n        required\n      />\n      {error && <div className=\"error\">{error}</div>}\n      <button type=\"submit\" disabled={isLoading}>\n        {isLoading ? 'Logging in...' : 'Login'}\n      </button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Creating a Custom Hook\n\nExtract reusable logic into custom hooks. Always prefix with \"use\":\n\n```javascript\n// Custom hook for form input management\nfunction useFormInput(initialValue) {\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);\n\n  const handleChange = useCallback((e) => {\n    setValue(e.target.value);\n  }, []);\n\n  const reset = useCallback(() => {\n    setValue(initialValue);\n  }, [initialValue]);\n\n  return {\n    value,\n    onChange: handleChange,\n    reset\n  };\n}\n\n// Usage in component\nfunction RegistrationForm() {\n  const emailInput = useFormInput('');\n  const passwordInput = useFormInput('');\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <input type=\"email\" {...emailInput} />\n      <input type=\"password\" {...passwordInput} />\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Data Fetching Pattern\n\nImplement proper data fetching with cleanup:\n\n```javascript\nfunction useData(url) {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n  const [error, setError] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (!url) return;\n\n    let ignore = false;\n    setLoading(true);\n\n    fetch(url)\n      .then(response => {\n        if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network error');\n        return response.json();\n      })\n      .then(json => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setData(json);\n          setError(null);\n        }\n      })\n      .catch(err => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setError(err.message);\n        }\n      })\n      .finally(() => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setLoading(false);\n        }\n      });\n\n    return () => {\n      ignore = true;\n    };\n  }, [url]);\n\n  return { data, loading, error };\n}\n\n// Usage\nfunction UserProfile({ userId }) {\n  const { data: user, loading, error } = useData(`/api/users/${userId}`);\n\n  if (loading) return <Loading />;\n  if (error) return <Error message={error} />;\n  if (!user) return null;\n\n  return <div>{user.name}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### Context and State Management\n\nImplement context with custom hooks for clean access:\n\n```javascript\n// Create context\nconst UserContext = createContext(null);\nconst UserDispatchContext = createContext(null);\n\n// Custom hooks for context access\nexport function useUser() {\n  const context = useContext(UserContext);\n  if (context === null) {\n    throw new Error('useUser must be used within UserProvider');\n  }\n  return context;\n}\n\nexport function useUserDispatch() {\n  const context = useContext(UserDispatchContext);\n  if (context === null) {\n    throw new Error('useUserDispatch must be used within UserProvider');\n  }\n  return context;\n}\n\n// Provider component\nexport function UserProvider({ children }) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n\n  const login = useCallback((userData) => {\n    setUser(userData);\n  }, []);\n\n  const logout = useCallback(() => {\n    setUser(null);\n  }, []);\n\n  const dispatch = useMemo(() => ({ login, logout }), [login, logout]);\n\n  return (\n    <UserContext.Provider value={user}>\n      <UserDispatchContext.Provider value={dispatch}>\n        {children}\n      </UserDispatchContext.Provider>\n    </UserContext.Provider>\n  );\n}\n\n// Usage in components\nfunction UserMenu() {\n  const user = useUser();\n  const { logout } = useUserDispatch();\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <span>{user.name}</span>\n      <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### List Rendering with Keys\n\nAlways use proper keys for list items:\n\n```javascript\nfunction TodoList({ todos }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {todos.map(todo => (\n        <TodoItem\n          key={todo.id}  // Use stable, unique ID\n          todo={todo}\n        />\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n\n// Managing list state immutably\nfunction TodoApp() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    const newTodo = { id: crypto.randomUUID(), text, completed: false };\n    setTodos([...todos, newTodo]);\n  };\n\n  const toggleTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.map(todo =>\n      todo.id === id ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed } : todo\n    ));\n  };\n\n  const removeTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.filter(todo => todo.id !== id));\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <TodoInput onAdd={addTodo} />\n      <TodoList\n        todos={todos}\n        onToggle={toggleTodo}\n        onRemove={removeTodo}\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Critical Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n### 1. Never Call Hooks Conditionally\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Component({ isLoggedIn }) {\n  if (isLoggedIn) {\n    const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n  }\n  return <div>...</div>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Component({ isLoggedIn }) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n\n  if (!isLoggedIn) return <Login />;\n\n  return <div>{user.name}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Never Mutate State or Props\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction TodoList({ todos }) {\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    todos.push({ text }); // Mutation!\n    setTodos(todos);\n  };\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction TodoList() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    setTodos([...todos, { text }]); // New array\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Never Define Components Inside Components\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Parent() {\n  function Child() {  // Re-created every render!\n    return <div>Child</div>;\n  }\n  return <Child />;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Child() {\n  return <div>Child</div>;\n}\n\nfunction Parent() {\n  return <Child />;\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Never Pass Hooks as Props\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Button({ useData }) {\n  const data = useData(); // Don't pass hooks as props\n  return <button>{data}</button>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Button() {\n  const data = useData(); // Call hooks directly\n  return <button>{data}</button>;\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Don't Use Effect for Derived State\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Component({ firstName, lastName }) {\n  const [fullName, setFullName] = useState('');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    setFullName(`${firstName} ${lastName}`);\n  }, [firstName, lastName]);\n\n  return <div>{fullName}</div>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Component({ firstName, lastName }) {\n  const fullName = `${firstName} ${lastName}`; // Derive during render\n  return <div>{fullName}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\n### Measure Before Optimizing\n\nUse React DevTools Profiler to identify actual performance issues. Don't prematurely optimize.\n\n### Memoization Techniques\n\n```javascript\n// Memoize expensive computations\nfunction ProductList({ products, category }) {\n  const filteredProducts = useMemo(() => {\n    return products.filter(p => p.category === category);\n  }, [products, category]);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {filteredProducts.map(product => (\n        <Product key={product.id} product={product} />\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n// Memoize callbacks passed to children\nfunction Parent() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n    setCount(c => c + 1);\n  }, []);\n\n  return <MemoizedChild onClick={handleClick} />;\n}\n\n// Memoize components\nconst MemoizedChild = React.memo(function Child({ onClick }) {\n  return <button onClick={onClick}>Click me</button>;\n});\n```\n\n## Reference Documentation\n\nFor comprehensive details on React best practices, patterns, and anti-patterns, refer to:\n- `references/react_best_practices.md` - Complete guide covering hooks, component patterns, purity, immutability, custom hooks, and modern React features\n\nLoad this reference when:\n- Implementing complex custom hooks\n- Debugging React-specific issues\n- Reviewing code for anti-patterns\n- Learning advanced patterns like context, reducers, or concurrent features\n- Optimizing performance\n\n## Implementation Checklist\n\nWhen creating or reviewing React components, verify:\n\n- [ ] Component defined at module level (not inside another component)\n- [ ] All hooks called at top level (no conditionals, loops, or early returns before hooks)\n- [ ] Hooks called in consistent order every render\n- [ ] State never mutated directly (always use setState with new values)\n- [ ] Props never mutated\n- [ ] No mutations after values passed to JSX\n- [ ] useEffect includes all dependencies\n- [ ] useEffect returns cleanup function when needed\n- [ ] Event handlers properly defined and named\n- [ ] Keys used correctly in list rendering (stable, unique IDs)\n- [ ] Derived state calculated during render (not in useEffect)\n- [ ] Custom hooks prefixed with \"use\"\n- [ ] Custom hooks follow Rules of Hooks\n- [ ] No hooks passed as props\n- [ ] Component is pure (same props → same output)\n- [ ] Performance optimizations only applied after measuring\n\n## Common Debugging Steps\n\nWhen encountering React issues:\n\n1. **State not updating**: Check for direct mutations, verify setState is called with new values\n2. **Infinite re-renders**: Check useEffect dependencies, verify state updates aren't unconditional\n3. **Stale closures**: Ensure dependencies are complete in useCallback/useMemo/useEffect\n4. **Hook errors**: Verify hooks are at top level, not conditional\n5. **Component not re-rendering**: Check if props/state are actually changing (reference equality)\n6. **Memory leaks**: Ensure useEffect cleanup functions properly cancel subscriptions\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":267,"oldLines":16,"newStart":267,"newLines":25,"lines":[" }"," ```"," ","-### Creating a Custom Hook","+### Creating a Custom Hook (TypeScript)"," "," Extract reusable logic into custom hooks.

This includes writing new React components, refactoring existing code, implementing React hooks, managing state, handling component lifecycle, optimizing performance, and following modern React best practices. The skill is particularly useful for tasks involving functional components, hooks patterns, custom hooks, and modern React features like concurrent rendering.\n---\n\n# React Component Creator\n\n## Overview\n\nThis skill provides comprehensive guidance for creating high-quality, production-ready React components following modern best practices. Use it when building new React components, refactoring existing code, implementing custom hooks, or optimizing React applications for performance and maintainability.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\nInvoke this skill for:\n- Creating new React functional components from scratch\n- Implementing React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.)\n- Building custom hooks for reusable logic\n- Refactoring class components to functional components\n- Optimizing component performance\n- Managing component state and lifecycle\n- Implementing proper data fetching patterns\n- Following React purity and immutability principles\n- Addressing React-specific bugs or anti-patterns\n\n## Core Principles\n\nBefore implementing any React component, adhere to these fundamental principles:\n\n1. **Components are pure functions** - Same props always produce the same output\n2. **Never mutate props or state** - Always create new objects/arrays\n3. **Hooks follow strict rules** - Top-level only, consistent order, no conditional calls\n4. **Components defined at module level** - Never create components inside other components\n5. **Immutability throughout** - No mutations after values are passed to JSX or hooks\n6. **TypeScript by default** - All components should use TypeScript for type safety\n7. **Server vs Client components** - In Next.js App Router, prefer Server Components by default; use \"use client\" directive only when needed\n\n## Component Creation Workflow\n\n### 1. Plan Component Structure\n\nBefore writing code, determine:\n- Is this a Server Component or Client Component? (Next.js App Router)\n- Is this a presentational or container component?\n- What props does it need? (Define TypeScript interface)\n- What local state is required?\n- What side effects need to be managed?\n- Are custom hooks needed for reusable logic?\n- Does it need error boundaries?\n\n### 2. Write the Component\n\nFollow this template structure for functional components:\n\n#### Client Component (TypeScript)\n\n```typescript\n'use client'; // Only if component uses hooks, browser APIs, or event handlers\n\nimport { useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo } from 'react';\n\ninterface ComponentNameProps {\n  prop1: string;\n  prop2: number;\n}\n\nexport function ComponentName({ prop1, prop2 }: ComponentNameProps) {\n  // 1. All hooks at the top level (never conditional)\n  const [state, setState] = useState<string>(initialValue);\n  const contextValue = useContext(SomeContext);\n\n  // 2. Derived values and memoization\n  const derivedValue = useMemo(() => {\n    return expensiveComputation(prop1, prop2);\n  }, [prop1, prop2]);\n\n  // 3. Event handlers and callbacks\n  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n    setState(newValue);\n  }, []);\n\n  // 4. Effects (for synchronization only)\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // Setup\n    const subscription = subscribe();\n\n    // Cleanup\n    return () => subscription.unsubscribe();\n  }, [dependencies]);\n\n  // 5. Early returns (after all hooks)\n  if (loading) return <Loading />;\n  if (error) return <Error message={error} />;\n\n  // 6. Render JSX\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>\n        {derivedValue}\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### Server Component (TypeScript - Next.js App Router)\n\n```typescript\n// No 'use client' directive - Server Component by default\n\ninterface UserProfileProps {\n  userId: string;\n}\n\nexport async function UserProfile({ userId }: UserProfileProps) {\n  // Server Components can be async and fetch data directly\n  const user = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`)\n    .then(res => res.json());\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{user.name}</h1>\n      <p>{user.email}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Validate Against Best Practices\n\nCheck the component against these criteria:\n- All hooks are called at the top level\n- No hooks after early returns or in conditionals\n- State is never mutated directly\n- Dependencies in useEffect/useCallback/useMemo are complete\n- Event handlers are properly defined\n- Props are not mutated\n- Component is defined at module level (not inside another component)\n\n### 4. Optimize if Needed\n\nApply optimizations only after measuring performance:\n- Wrap expensive computations in `useMemo`\n- Wrap callback functions in `useCallback` when passed to memoized children\n- Use `React.memo` for components that re-render unnecessarily\n- Consider code splitting for large components\n\n## Next.js App Router Specifics\n\n### Server vs Client Components\n\n**Server Components (Default):**\n- No \"use client\" directive needed\n- Can be async functions\n- Can fetch data directly with await\n- Rendered on the server\n- Cannot use hooks, event handlers, or browser APIs\n- Smaller JavaScript bundle\n\n**Client Components:**\n- Require \"use client\" directive at the top of the file\n- Can use hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)\n- Can use event handlers (onClick, onChange, etc.)\n- Can access browser APIs (window, localStorage, etc.)\n- Rendered on both server (initial) and client (hydration)\n\n```typescript\n// Server Component - prefer by default\nexport async function BlogPost({ slug }: { slug: string }) {\n  const post = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/posts/${slug}`)\n    .then(res => res.json());\n\n  return <article>{post.content}</article>;\n}\n\n// Client Component - only when needed\n'use client';\n\nexport function LikeButton({ postId }: { postId: string }) {\n  const [liked, setLiked] = useState(false);\n\n  return (\n    <button onClick={() => setLiked(!liked)}>\n      {liked ? '❤️' : '🤍'}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Composition Pattern\n\nCombine Server and Client Components effectively:\n\n```typescript\n// app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx (Server Component)\nimport { LikeButton } from '@/components/LikeButton';\n\nexport default async function BlogPage({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {\n  const post = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/posts/${params.slug}`)\n    .then(res => res.json());\n\n  return (\n    <article>\n      <h1>{post.title}</h1>\n      <div>{post.content}</div>\n      <LikeButton postId={post.id} /> {/* Client Component */}\n    </article>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Common Tasks\n\n### Creating a Form Component (TypeScript)\n\n```typescript\n'use client';\n\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\ninterface LoginFormProps {\n  onSuccess?: () => void;\n}\n\nexport function LoginForm({ onSuccess }: LoginFormProps) {\n  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');\n  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');\n  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);\n  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    setError(null);\n    setIsLoading(true);\n\n    try {\n      await login(email, password);\n      onSuccess?.();\n    } catch (err) {\n      setError(err instanceof Error ? err.message : 'Login failed');\n    } finally {\n      setIsLoading(false);\n    }\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      <input\n        type=\"email\"\n        value={email}\n        onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}\n        disabled={isLoading}\n        required\n      />\n      <input\n        type=\"password\"\n        value={password}\n        onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}\n        disabled={isLoading}\n        required\n      />\n      {error && <div className=\"error\">{error}</div>}\n      <button type=\"submit\" disabled={isLoading}>\n        {isLoading ? 'Logging in...' : 'Login'}\n      </button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Creating a Custom Hook (TypeScript)\n\nExtract reusable logic into custom hooks. Always prefix with \"use\":\n\n```typescript\n'use client';\n\nimport { useState, useCallback, ChangeEvent } from 'react';\n\ninterface UseFormInputReturn {\n  value: string;\n  onChange: (e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => void;\n  reset: () => void;\n}\n\nfunction useFormInput(initialValue: string): UseFormInputReturn {\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);\n\n  const handleChange = useCallback((e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {\n    setValue(e.target.value);\n  }, []);\n\n  const reset = useCallback(() => {\n    setValue(initialValue);\n  }, [initialValue]);\n\n  return {\n    value,\n    onChange: handleChange,\n    reset\n  };\n}\n\n// Usage in component\nexport function RegistrationForm() {\n  const emailInput = useFormInput('');\n  const passwordInput = useFormInput('');\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <input type=\"email\" {...emailInput} />\n      <input type=\"password\" {...passwordInput} />\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Data Fetching Pattern\n\nImplement proper data fetching with cleanup:\n\n```javascript\nfunction useData(url) {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n  const [error, setError] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (!url) return;\n\n    let ignore = false;\n    setLoading(true);\n\n    fetch(url)\n      .then(response => {\n        if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network error');\n        return response.json();\n      })\n      .then(json => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setData(json);\n          setError(null);\n        }\n      })\n      .catch(err => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setError(err.message);\n        }\n      })\n      .finally(() => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setLoading(false);\n        }\n      });\n\n    return () => {\n      ignore = true;\n    };\n  }, [url]);\n\n  return { data, loading, error };\n}\n\n// Usage\nfunction UserProfile({ userId }) {\n  const { data: user, loading, error } = useData(`/api/users/${userId}`);\n\n  if (loading) return <Loading />;\n  if (error) return <Error message={error} />;\n  if (!user) return null;\n\n  return <div>{user.name}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### Context and State Management\n\nImplement context with custom hooks for clean access:\n\n```javascript\n// Create context\nconst UserContext = createContext(null);\nconst UserDispatchContext = createContext(null);\n\n// Custom hooks for context access\nexport function useUser() {\n  const context = useContext(UserContext);\n  if (context === null) {\n    throw new Error('useUser must be used within UserProvider');\n  }\n  return context;\n}\n\nexport function useUserDispatch() {\n  const context = useContext(UserDispatchContext);\n  if (context === null) {\n    throw new Error('useUserDispatch must be used within UserProvider');\n  }\n  return context;\n}\n\n// Provider component\nexport function UserProvider({ children }) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n\n  const login = useCallback((userData) => {\n    setUser(userData);\n  }, []);\n\n  const logout = useCallback(() => {\n    setUser(null);\n  }, []);\n\n  const dispatch = useMemo(() => ({ login, logout }), [login, logout]);\n\n  return (\n    <UserContext.Provider value={user}>\n      <UserDispatchContext.Provider value={dispatch}>\n        {children}\n      </UserDispatchContext.Provider>\n    </UserContext.Provider>\n  );\n}\n\n// Usage in components\nfunction UserMenu() {\n  const user = useUser();\n  const { logout } = useUserDispatch();\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <span>{user.name}</span>\n      <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### List Rendering with Keys\n\nAlways use proper keys for list items:\n\n```javascript\nfunction TodoList({ todos }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {todos.map(todo => (\n        <TodoItem\n          key={todo.id}  // Use stable, unique ID\n          todo={todo}\n        />\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n\n// Managing list state immutably\nfunction TodoApp() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    const newTodo = { id: crypto.randomUUID(), text, completed: false };\n    setTodos([...todos, newTodo]);\n  };\n\n  const toggleTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.map(todo =>\n      todo.id === id ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed } : todo\n    ));\n  };\n\n  const removeTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.filter(todo => todo.id !== id));\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <TodoInput onAdd={addTodo} />\n      <TodoList\n        todos={todos}\n        onToggle={toggleTodo}\n        onRemove={removeTodo}\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Critical Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n### 1. Never Call Hooks Conditionally\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Component({ isLoggedIn }) {\n  if (isLoggedIn) {\n    const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n  }\n  return <div>...</div>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Component({ isLoggedIn }) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n\n  if (!isLoggedIn) return <Login />;\n\n  return <div>{user.name}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Never Mutate State or Props\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction TodoList({ todos }) {\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    todos.push({ text }); // Mutation!\n    setTodos(todos);\n  };\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction TodoList() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    setTodos([...todos, { text }]); // New array\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Never Define Components Inside Components\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Parent() {\n  function Child() {  // Re-created every render!\n    return <div>Child</div>;\n  }\n  return <Child />;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Child() {\n  return <div>Child</div>;\n}\n\nfunction Parent() {\n  return <Child />;\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Never Pass Hooks as Props\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Button({ useData }) {\n  const data = useData(); // Don't pass hooks as props\n  return <button>{data}</button>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Button() {\n  const data = useData(); // Call hooks directly\n  return <button>{data}</button>;\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Don't Use Effect for Derived State\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Component({ firstName, lastName }) {\n  const [fullName, setFullName] = useState('');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    setFullName(`${firstName} ${lastName}`);\n  }, [firstName, lastName]);\n\n  return <div>{fullName}</div>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Component({ firstName, lastName }) {\n  const fullName = `${firstName} ${lastName}`; // Derive during render\n  return <div>{fullName}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\n### Measure Before Optimizing\n\nUse React DevTools Profiler to identify actual performance issues. Don't prematurely optimize.\n\n### Memoization Techniques\n\n```javascript\n// Memoize expensive computations\nfunction ProductList({ products, category }) {\n  const filteredProducts = useMemo(() => {\n    return products.filter(p => p.category === category);\n  }, [products, category]);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {filteredProducts.map(product => (\n        <Product key={product.id} product={product} />\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n// Memoize callbacks passed to children\nfunction Parent() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n    setCount(c => c + 1);\n  }, []);\n\n  return <MemoizedChild onClick={handleClick} />;\n}\n\n// Memoize components\nconst MemoizedChild = React.memo(function Child({ onClick }) {\n  return <button onClick={onClick}>Click me</button>;\n});\n```\n\n## Reference Documentation\n\nFor comprehensive details on React best practices, patterns, and anti-patterns, refer to:\n- `references/react_best_practices.md` - Complete guide covering hooks, component patterns, purity, immutability, custom hooks, and modern React features\n\nLoad this reference when:\n- Implementing complex custom hooks\n- Debugging React-specific issues\n- Reviewing code for anti-patterns\n- Learning advanced patterns like context, reducers, or concurrent features\n- Optimizing performance\n\n## Implementation Checklist\n\nWhen creating or reviewing React components, verify:\n\n- [ ] Component defined at module level (not inside another component)\n- [ ] All hooks called at top level (no conditionals, loops, or early returns before hooks)\n- [ ] Hooks called in consistent order every render\n- [ ] State never mutated directly (always use setState with new values)\n- [ ] Props never mutated\n- [ ] No mutations after values passed to JSX\n- [ ] useEffect includes all dependencies\n- [ ] useEffect returns cleanup function when needed\n- [ ] Event handlers properly defined and named\n- [ ] Keys used correctly in list rendering (stable, unique IDs)\n- [ ] Derived state calculated during render (not in useEffect)\n- [ ] Custom hooks prefixed with \"use\"\n- [ ] Custom hooks follow Rules of Hooks\n- [ ] No hooks passed as props\n- [ ] Component is pure (same props → same output)\n- [ ] Performance optimizations only applied after measuring\n\n## Common Debugging Steps\n\nWhen encountering React issues:\n\n1. **State not updating**: Check for direct mutations, verify setState is called with new values\n2. **Infinite re-renders**: Check useEffect dependencies, verify state updates aren't unconditional\n3. **Stale closures**: Ensure dependencies are complete in useCallback/useMemo/useEffect\n4. **Hook errors**: Verify hooks are at top level, not conditional\n5. **Component not re-rendering**: Check if props/state are actually changing (reference equality)\n6. **Memory leaks**: Ensure useEffect cleanup functions properly cancel subscriptions\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":314,"oldLines":15,"newStart":314,"newLines":105,"lines":[" }"," ```"," ","-### Data Fetching Pattern","+### Data Fetching Patterns"," ","-Implement proper data fetching with cleanup:","+#### Option 1: Server Component (Preferred for Next.js App Router)"," ","-```javascript","-function useData(url) {","-  const [data, setData] = useState(null);","+```typescript","+// No 'use client' -

react-component-creator\ndescription: Use this skill when creating, modifying, or optimizing React components and applications. This includes writing new React components, refactoring existing code, implementing React hooks, managing state, handling component lifecycle, optimizing performance, and following modern React best practices. The skill is particularly useful for tasks involving functional components, hooks patterns, custom hooks, and modern React features like concurrent rendering.\n---\n\n# React Component Creator\n\n## Overview\n\nThis skill provides comprehensive guidance for creating high-quality, production-ready React components following modern best practices. Use it when building new React components, refactoring existing code, implementing custom hooks, or optimizing React applications for performance and maintainability.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\nInvoke this skill for:\n- Creating new React functional components from scratch\n- Implementing React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.)\n- Building custom hooks for reusable logic\n- Refactoring class components to functional components\n- Optimizing component performance\n- Managing component state and lifecycle\n- Implementing proper data fetching patterns\n- Following React purity and immutability principles\n- Addressing React-specific bugs or anti-patterns\n\n## Core Principles\n\nBefore implementing any React component, adhere to these fundamental principles:\n\n1. **Components are pure functions** - Same props always produce the same output\n2. **Never mutate props or state** - Always create new objects/arrays\n3. **Hooks follow strict rules** - Top-level only, consistent order, no conditional calls\n4. **Components defined at module level** - Never create components inside other components\n5. **Immutability throughout** - No mutations after values are passed to JSX or hooks\n6. **TypeScript by default** - All components should use TypeScript for type safety\n7. **Server vs Client components** - In Next.js App Router, prefer Server Components by default; use \"use client\" directive only when needed\n\n## Component Creation Workflow\n\n### 1. Plan Component Structure\n\nBefore writing code, determine:\n- Is this a Server Component or Client Component? (Next.js App Router)\n- Is this a presentational or container component?\n- What props does it need? (Define TypeScript interface)\n- What local state is required?\n- What side effects need to be managed?\n- Are custom hooks needed for reusable logic?\n- Does it need error boundaries?\n\n### 2. Write the Component\n\nFollow this template structure for functional components:\n\n#### Client Component (TypeScript)\n\n```typescript\n'use client'; // Only if component uses hooks, browser APIs, or event handlers\n\nimport { useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo } from 'react';\n\ninterface ComponentNameProps {\n  prop1: string;\n  prop2: number;\n}\n\nexport function ComponentName({ prop1, prop2 }: ComponentNameProps) {\n  // 1. All hooks at the top level (never conditional)\n  const [state, setState] = useState<string>(initialValue);\n  const contextValue = useContext(SomeContext);\n\n  // 2. Derived values and memoization\n  const derivedValue = useMemo(() => {\n    return expensiveComputation(prop1, prop2);\n  }, [prop1, prop2]);\n\n  // 3. Event handlers and callbacks\n  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n    setState(newValue);\n  }, []);\n\n  // 4. Effects (for synchronization only)\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // Setup\n    const subscription = subscribe();\n\n    // Cleanup\n    return () => subscription.unsubscribe();\n  }, [dependencies]);\n\n  // 5. Early returns (after all hooks)\n  if (loading) return <Loading />;\n  if (error) return <Error message={error} />;\n\n  // 6. Render JSX\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>\n        {derivedValue}\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### Server Component (TypeScript - Next.js App Router)\n\n```typescript\n// No 'use client' directive - Server Component by default\n\ninterface UserProfileProps {\n  userId: string;\n}\n\nexport async function UserProfile({ userId }: UserProfileProps) {\n  // Server Components can be async and fetch data directly\n  const user = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`)\n    .then(res => res.json());\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{user.name}</h1>\n      <p>{user.email}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Validate Against Best Practices\n\nCheck the component against these criteria:\n- All hooks are called at the top level\n- No hooks after early returns or in conditionals\n- State is never mutated directly\n- Dependencies in useEffect/useCallback/useMemo are complete\n- Event handlers are properly defined\n- Props are not mutated\n- Component is defined at module level (not inside another component)\n\n### 4. Optimize if Needed\n\nApply optimizations only after measuring performance:\n- Wrap expensive computations in `useMemo`\n- Wrap callback functions in `useCallback` when passed to memoized children\n- Use `React.memo` for components that re-render unnecessarily\n- Consider code splitting for large components\n\n## Next.js App Router Specifics\n\n### Server vs Client Components\n\n**Server Components (Default):**\n- No \"use client\" directive needed\n- Can be async functions\n- Can fetch data directly with await\n- Rendered on the server\n- Cannot use hooks, event handlers, or browser APIs\n- Smaller JavaScript bundle\n\n**Client Components:**\n- Require \"use client\" directive at the top of the file\n- Can use hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)\n- Can use event handlers (onClick, onChange, etc.)\n- Can access browser APIs (window, localStorage, etc.)\n- Rendered on both server (initial) and client (hydration)\n\n```typescript\n// Server Component - prefer by default\nexport async function BlogPost({ slug }: { slug: string }) {\n  const post = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/posts/${slug}`)\n    .then(res => res.json());\n\n  return <article>{post.content}</article>;\n}\n\n// Client Component - only when needed\n'use client';\n\nexport function LikeButton({ postId }: { postId: string }) {\n  const [liked, setLiked] = useState(false);\n\n  return (\n    <button onClick={() => setLiked(!liked)}>\n      {liked ? '❤️' : '🤍'}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Composition Pattern\n\nCombine Server and Client Components effectively:\n\n```typescript\n// app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx (Server Component)\nimport { LikeButton } from '@/components/LikeButton';\n\nexport default async function BlogPage({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {\n  const post = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/posts/${params.slug}`)\n    .then(res => res.json());\n\n  return (\n    <article>\n      <h1>{post.title}</h1>\n      <div>{post.content}</div>\n      <LikeButton postId={post.id} /> {/* Client Component */}\n    </article>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Common Tasks\n\n### Creating a Form Component (TypeScript)\n\n```typescript\n'use client';\n\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\ninterface LoginFormProps {\n  onSuccess?: () => void;\n}\n\nexport function LoginForm({ onSuccess }: LoginFormProps) {\n  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');\n  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');\n  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);\n  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    setError(null);\n    setIsLoading(true);\n\n    try {\n      await login(email, password);\n      onSuccess?.();\n    } catch (err) {\n      setError(err instanceof Error ? err.message : 'Login failed');\n    } finally {\n      setIsLoading(false);\n    }\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      <input\n        type=\"email\"\n        value={email}\n        onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}\n        disabled={isLoading}\n        required\n      />\n      <input\n        type=\"password\"\n        value={password}\n        onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}\n        disabled={isLoading}\n        required\n      />\n      {error && <div className=\"error\">{error}</div>}\n      <button type=\"submit\" disabled={isLoading}>\n        {isLoading ? 'Logging in...' : 'Login'}\n      </button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Creating a Custom Hook (TypeScript)\n\nExtract reusable logic into custom hooks. Always prefix with \"use\":\n\n```typescript\n'use client';\n\nimport { useState, useCallback, ChangeEvent } from 'react';\n\ninterface UseFormInputReturn {\n  value: string;\n  onChange: (e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => void;\n  reset: () => void;\n}\n\nfunction useFormInput(initialValue: string): UseFormInputReturn {\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);\n\n  const handleChange = useCallback((e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {\n    setValue(e.target.value);\n  }, []);\n\n  const reset = useCallback(() => {\n    setValue(initialValue);\n  }, [initialValue]);\n\n  return {\n    value,\n    onChange: handleChange,\n    reset\n  };\n}\n\n// Usage in component\nexport function RegistrationForm() {\n  const emailInput = useFormInput('');\n  const passwordInput = useFormInput('');\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <input type=\"email\" {...emailInput} />\n      <input type=\"password\" {...passwordInput} />\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Data Fetching Patterns\n\n#### Option 1: Server Component (Preferred for Next.js App Router)\n\n```typescript\n// No 'use client' - Server Component\ninterface User {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  email: string;\n}\n\ninterface UserProfileProps {\n  userId: string;\n}\n\nexport async function UserProfile({ userId }: UserProfileProps) {\n  // Direct async/await in Server Component\n  const user: User = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`, {\n    next: { revalidate: 3600 } // Cache for 1 hour\n  }).then(res => {\n    if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch user');\n    return res.json();\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{user.name}</h1>\n      <p>{user.email}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### Option 2: Client Component with `use` Hook (React 19)\n\n```typescript\n'use client';\n\nimport { use, Suspense } from 'react';\n\ninterface User {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n}\n\nasync function fetchUser(userId: string): Promise<User> {\n  const res = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);\n  if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch');\n  return res.json();\n}\n\ninterface UserProfileProps {\n  userId: string;\n}\n\nfunction UserProfile({ userId }: UserProfileProps) {\n  // React 19 'use' hook - unwraps promises\n  const user = use(fetchUser(userId));\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{user.name}</h1>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n// Wrap with Suspense boundary\nexport function UserProfileWithSuspense({ userId }: UserProfileProps) {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n      <UserProfile userId={userId} />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### Option 3: Client Component with useEffect (Legacy Pattern)\n\n```typescript\n'use client';\n\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\ninterface User {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n}\n\ninterface UseDataReturn<T> {\n  data: T | null;\n  loading: boolean;\n  error: string | null;\n}\n\nfunction useData<T>(url: string | null): UseDataReturn<T> {\n  const [data, setData] = useState<T | null>(null);\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (!url) return;\n\n    let ignore = false;\n    setLoading(true);\n\n    fetch(url)\n      .then(response => {\n        if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network error');\n        return response.json();\n      })\n      .then(json => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setData(json);\n          setError(null);\n        }\n      })\n      .catch(err => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setError(err instanceof Error ? err.message : 'An error occurred');\n        }\n      })\n      .finally(() => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setLoading(false);\n        }\n      });\n\n    return () => {\n      ignore = true;\n    };\n  }, [url]);\n\n  return { data, loading, error };\n}\n\n// Usage\nexport function UserProfile({ userId }: { userId: string }) {\n  const { data: user, loading, error } = useData<User>(`/api/users/${userId}`);\n\n  if (loading) return <Loading />;\n  if (error) return <Error message={error} />;\n  if (!user) return null;\n\n  return <div>{user.name}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### Context and State Management\n\nImplement context with custom hooks for clean access:\n\n```javascript\n// Create context\nconst UserContext = createContext(null);\nconst UserDispatchContext = createContext(null);\n\n// Custom hooks for context access\nexport function useUser() {\n  const context = useContext(UserContext);\n  if (context === null) {\n    throw new Error('useUser must be used within UserProvider');\n  }\n  return context;\n}\n\nexport function useUserDispatch() {\n  const context = useContext(UserDispatchContext);\n  if (context === null) {\n    throw new Error('useUserDispatch must be used within UserProvider');\n  }\n  return context;\n}\n\n// Provider component\nexport function UserProvider({ children }) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n\n  const login = useCallback((userData) => {\n    setUser(userData);\n  }, []);\n\n  const logout = useCallback(() => {\n    setUser(null);\n  }, []);\n\n  const dispatch = useMemo(() => ({ login, logout }), [login, logout]);\n\n  return (\n    <UserContext.Provider value={user}>\n      <UserDispatchContext.Provider value={dispatch}>\n        {children}\n      </UserDispatchContext.Provider>\n    </UserContext.Provider>\n  );\n}\n\n// Usage in components\nfunction UserMenu() {\n  const user = useUser();\n  const { logout } = useUserDispatch();\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <span>{user.name}</span>\n      <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### List Rendering with Keys\n\nAlways use proper keys for list items:\n\n```javascript\nfunction TodoList({ todos }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {todos.map(todo => (\n        <TodoItem\n          key={todo.id}  // Use stable, unique ID\n          todo={todo}\n        />\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n\n// Managing list state immutably\nfunction TodoApp() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    const newTodo = { id: crypto.randomUUID(), text, completed: false };\n    setTodos([...todos, newTodo]);\n  };\n\n  const toggleTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.map(todo =>\n      todo.id === id ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed } : todo\n    ));\n  };\n\n  const removeTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.filter(todo => todo.id !== id));\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <TodoInput onAdd={addTodo} />\n      <TodoList\n        todos={todos}\n        onToggle={toggleTodo}\n        onRemove={removeTodo}\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Critical Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n### 1. Never Call Hooks Conditionally\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Component({ isLoggedIn }) {\n  if (isLoggedIn) {\n    const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n  }\n  return <div>...</div>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Component({ isLoggedIn }) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n\n  if (!isLoggedIn) return <Login />;\n\n  return <div>{user.name}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Never Mutate State or Props\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction TodoList({ todos }) {\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    todos.push({ text }); // Mutation!\n    setTodos(todos);\n  };\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction TodoList() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    setTodos([...todos, { text }]); // New array\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Never Define Components Inside Components\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Parent() {\n  function Child() {  // Re-created every render!\n    return <div>Child</div>;\n  }\n  return <Child />;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Child() {\n  return <div>Child</div>;\n}\n\nfunction Parent() {\n  return <Child />;\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Never Pass Hooks as Props\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Button({ useData }) {\n  const data = useData(); // Don't pass hooks as props\n  return <button>{data}</button>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Button() {\n  const data = useData(); // Call hooks directly\n  return <button>{data}</button>;\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Don't Use Effect for Derived State\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Component({ firstName, lastName }) {\n  const [fullName, setFullName] = useState('');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    setFullName(`${firstName} ${lastName}`);\n  }, [firstName, lastName]);\n\n  return <div>{fullName}</div>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Component({ firstName, lastName }) {\n  const fullName = `${firstName} ${lastName}`; // Derive during render\n  return <div>{fullName}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\n### Measure Before Optimizing\n\nUse React DevTools Profiler to identify actual performance issues. Don't prematurely optimize.\n\n### Memoization Techniques\n\n```javascript\n// Memoize expensive computations\nfunction ProductList({ products, category }) {\n  const filteredProducts = useMemo(() => {\n    return products.filter(p => p.category === category);\n  }, [products, category]);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {filteredProducts.map(product => (\n        <Product key={product.id} product={product} />\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n// Memoize callbacks passed to children\nfunction Parent() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n    setCount(c => c + 1);\n  }, []);\n\n  return <MemoizedChild onClick={handleClick} />;\n}\n\n// Memoize components\nconst MemoizedChild = React.memo(function Child({ onClick }) {\n  return <button onClick={onClick}>Click me</button>;\n});\n```\n\n## Reference Documentation\n\nFor comprehensive details on React best practices, patterns, and anti-patterns, refer to:\n- `references/react_best_practices.md` - Complete guide covering hooks, component patterns, purity, immutability, custom hooks, and modern React features\n\nLoad this reference when:\n- Implementing complex custom hooks\n- Debugging React-specific issues\n- Reviewing code for anti-patterns\n- Learning advanced patterns like context, reducers, or concurrent features\n- Optimizing performance\n\n## Implementation Checklist\n\nWhen creating or reviewing React components, verify:\n\n- [ ] Component defined at module level (not inside another component)\n- [ ] All hooks called at top level (no conditionals, loops, or early returns before hooks)\n- [ ] Hooks called in consistent order every render\n- [ ] State never mutated directly (always use setState with new values)\n- [ ] Props never mutated\n- [ ] No mutations after values passed to JSX\n- [ ] useEffect includes all dependencies\n- [ ] useEffect returns cleanup function when needed\n- [ ] Event handlers properly defined and named\n- [ ] Keys used correctly in list rendering (stable, unique IDs)\n- [ ] Derived state calculated during render (not in useEffect)\n- [ ] Custom hooks prefixed with \"use\"\n- [ ] Custom hooks follow Rules of Hooks\n- [ ] No hooks passed as props\n- [ ] Component is pure (same props → same output)\n- [ ] Performance optimizations only applied after measuring\n\n## Common Debugging Steps\n\nWhen encountering React issues:\n\n1. **State not updating**: Check for direct mutations, verify setState is called with new values\n2. **Infinite re-renders**: Check useEffect dependencies, verify state updates aren't unconditional\n3. **Stale closures**: Ensure dependencies are complete in useCallback/useMemo/useEffect\n4. **Hook errors**: Verify hooks are at top level, not conditional\n5. **Component not re-rendering**: Check if props/state are actually changing (reference equality)\n6. **Memory leaks**: Ensure useEffect cleanup functions properly cancel subscriptions\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":462,"oldLines":15,"newStart":462,"newLines":29,"lines":[" }"," ```"," ","-### Context and State Management","+### Context and State Management (TypeScript)"," "," Implement context with custom hooks for clean access:"," ","-```javascript","-// Create context","-const UserContext = createContext(null);","-const UserDispatchContext = createContext(null);","+```typescript","+'use client';"," ","+import { createContext, useContext, useState, useCallback, useMemo, ReactNode } from 'react';","+","+interface User {","+  id: string;","+  name: string;","+  email: string;","+}","+","+interface UserDispatch {","+  login: (userData: User) => void;","+  logout: () => void;","+}","+","+const UserContext = createContext<User | null>(null);","+const UserDispatchContext = createContext<UserDispatch | null>(null);","+"," // Custom hooks for context access"," export function useUser() {","   const context = useContext(UserContext);"]},{"oldStart":489,"oldLines":10,"newStart":503,"newLines":10,"lines":[" }"," "," // Provider component","-export function UserProvider({ children }) {","-  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);","+export function UserProvider({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {","+  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);"," ","-  const login = useCallback((userData) => {","+  const login = useCallback((userData: User) => {","     setUser(userData);","   }, []);"," "]},{"oldStart":512,"oldLines":7,"newStart":526,"newLines":7,"lines":[" }"," "," // Usage in components","-function UserMenu() {","+export function UserMenu() {","   const user = useUser();","   const { logout } = useUserDispatch();"," "]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

This includes writing new React components, refactoring existing code, implementing React hooks, managing state, handling component lifecycle, optimizing performance, and following modern React best practices. The skill is particularly useful for tasks involving functional components, hooks patterns, custom hooks, and modern React features like concurrent rendering.\n---\n\n# React Component Creator\n\n## Overview\n\nThis skill provides comprehensive guidance for creating high-quality, production-ready React components following modern best practices. Use it when building new React components, refactoring existing code, implementing custom hooks, or optimizing React applications for performance and maintainability.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\nInvoke this skill for:\n- Creating new React functional components from scratch\n- Implementing React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.)\n- Building custom hooks for reusable logic\n- Refactoring class components to functional components\n- Optimizing component performance\n- Managing component state and lifecycle\n- Implementing proper data fetching patterns\n- Following React purity and immutability principles\n- Addressing React-specific bugs or anti-patterns\n\n## Core Principles\n\nBefore implementing any React component, adhere to these fundamental principles:\n\n1. **Components are pure functions** - Same props always produce the same output\n2. **Never mutate props or state** - Always create new objects/arrays\n3. **Hooks follow strict rules** - Top-level only, consistent order, no conditional calls\n4. **Components defined at module level** - Never create components inside other components\n5. **Immutability throughout** - No mutations after values are passed to JSX or hooks\n6. **TypeScript by default** - All components should use TypeScript for type safety\n7. **Server vs Client components** - In Next.js App Router, prefer Server Components by default; use \"use client\" directive only when needed\n\n## Component Creation Workflow\n\n### 1. Plan Component Structure\n\nBefore writing code, determine:\n- Is this a Server Component or Client Component? (Next.js App Router)\n- Is this a presentational or container component?\n- What props does it need? (Define TypeScript interface)\n- What local state is required?\n- What side effects need to be managed?\n- Are custom hooks needed for reusable logic?\n- Does it need error boundaries?\n\n### 2. Write the Component\n\nFollow this template structure for functional components:\n\n#### Client Component (TypeScript)\n\n```typescript\n'use client'; // Only if component uses hooks, browser APIs, or event handlers\n\nimport { useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo } from 'react';\n\ninterface ComponentNameProps {\n  prop1: string;\n  prop2: number;\n}\n\nexport function ComponentName({ prop1, prop2 }: ComponentNameProps) {\n  // 1. All hooks at the top level (never conditional)\n  const [state, setState] = useState<string>(initialValue);\n  const contextValue = useContext(SomeContext);\n\n  // 2. Derived values and memoization\n  const derivedValue = useMemo(() => {\n    return expensiveComputation(prop1, prop2);\n  }, [prop1, prop2]);\n\n  // 3. Event handlers and callbacks\n  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n    setState(newValue);\n  }, []);\n\n  // 4. Effects (for synchronization only)\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // Setup\n    const subscription = subscribe();\n\n    // Cleanup\n    return () => subscription.unsubscribe();\n  }, [dependencies]);\n\n  // 5. Early returns (after all hooks)\n  if (loading) return <Loading />;\n  if (error) return <Error message={error} />;\n\n  // 6. Render JSX\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>\n        {derivedValue}\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### Server Component (TypeScript - Next.js App Router)\n\n```typescript\n// No 'use client' directive - Server Component by default\n\ninterface UserProfileProps {\n  userId: string;\n}\n\nexport async function UserProfile({ userId }: UserProfileProps) {\n  // Server Components can be async and fetch data directly\n  const user = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`)\n    .then(res => res.json());\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{user.name}</h1>\n      <p>{user.email}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Validate Against Best Practices\n\nCheck the component against these criteria:\n- All hooks are called at the top level\n- No hooks after early returns or in conditionals\n- State is never mutated directly\n- Dependencies in useEffect/useCallback/useMemo are complete\n- Event handlers are properly defined\n- Props are not mutated\n- Component is defined at module level (not inside another component)\n\n### 4. Optimize if Needed\n\nApply optimizations only after measuring performance:\n- Wrap expensive computations in `useMemo`\n- Wrap callback functions in `useCallback` when passed to memoized children\n- Use `React.memo` for components that re-render unnecessarily\n- Consider code splitting for large components\n\n## Next.js App Router Specifics\n\n### Server vs Client Components\n\n**Server Components (Default):**\n- No \"use client\" directive needed\n- Can be async functions\n- Can fetch data directly with await\n- Rendered on the server\n- Cannot use hooks, event handlers, or browser APIs\n- Smaller JavaScript bundle\n\n**Client Components:**\n- Require \"use client\" directive at the top of the file\n- Can use hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)\n- Can use event handlers (onClick, onChange, etc.)\n- Can access browser APIs (window, localStorage, etc.)\n- Rendered on both server (initial) and client (hydration)\n\n```typescript\n// Server Component - prefer by default\nexport async function BlogPost({ slug }: { slug: string }) {\n  const post = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/posts/${slug}`)\n    .then(res => res.json());\n\n  return <article>{post.content}</article>;\n}\n\n// Client Component - only when needed\n'use client';\n\nexport function LikeButton({ postId }: { postId: string }) {\n  const [liked, setLiked] = useState(false);\n\n  return (\n    <button onClick={() => setLiked(!liked)}>\n      {liked ? '❤️' : '🤍'}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Composition Pattern\n\nCombine Server and Client Components effectively:\n\n```typescript\n// app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx (Server Component)\nimport { LikeButton } from '@/components/LikeButton';\n\nexport default async function BlogPage({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {\n  const post = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/posts/${params.slug}`)\n    .then(res => res.json());\n\n  return (\n    <article>\n      <h1>{post.title}</h1>\n      <div>{post.content}</div>\n      <LikeButton postId={post.id} /> {/* Client Component */}\n    </article>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Common Tasks\n\n### Creating a Form Component (TypeScript)\n\n```typescript\n'use client';\n\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\ninterface LoginFormProps {\n  onSuccess?: () => void;\n}\n\nexport function LoginForm({ onSuccess }: LoginFormProps) {\n  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');\n  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');\n  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);\n  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    setError(null);\n    setIsLoading(true);\n\n    try {\n      await login(email, password);\n      onSuccess?.();\n    } catch (err) {\n      setError(err instanceof Error ? err.message : 'Login failed');\n    } finally {\n      setIsLoading(false);\n    }\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      <input\n        type=\"email\"\n        value={email}\n        onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}\n        disabled={isLoading}\n        required\n      />\n      <input\n        type=\"password\"\n        value={password}\n        onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}\n        disabled={isLoading}\n        required\n      />\n      {error && <div className=\"error\">{error}</div>}\n      <button type=\"submit\" disabled={isLoading}>\n        {isLoading ? 'Logging in...' : 'Login'}\n      </button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Creating a Custom Hook (TypeScript)\n\nExtract reusable logic into custom hooks. Always prefix with \"use\":\n\n```typescript\n'use client';\n\nimport { useState, useCallback, ChangeEvent } from 'react';\n\ninterface UseFormInputReturn {\n  value: string;\n  onChange: (e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => void;\n  reset: () => void;\n}\n\nfunction useFormInput(initialValue: string): UseFormInputReturn {\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);\n\n  const handleChange = useCallback((e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {\n    setValue(e.target.value);\n  }, []);\n\n  const reset = useCallback(() => {\n    setValue(initialValue);\n  }, [initialValue]);\n\n  return {\n    value,\n    onChange: handleChange,\n    reset\n  };\n}\n\n// Usage in component\nexport function RegistrationForm() {\n  const emailInput = useFormInput('');\n  const passwordInput = useFormInput('');\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <input type=\"email\" {...emailInput} />\n      <input type=\"password\" {...passwordInput} />\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Data Fetching Patterns\n\n#### Option 1: Server Component (Preferred for Next.js App Router)\n\n```typescript\n// No 'use client' - Server Component\ninterface User {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  email: string;\n}\n\ninterface UserProfileProps {\n  userId: string;\n}\n\nexport async function UserProfile({ userId }: UserProfileProps) {\n  // Direct async/await in Server Component\n  const user: User = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`, {\n    next: { revalidate: 3600 } // Cache for 1 hour\n  }).then(res => {\n    if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch user');\n    return res.json();\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{user.name}</h1>\n      <p>{user.email}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### Option 2: Client Component with `use` Hook (React 19)\n\n```typescript\n'use client';\n\nimport { use, Suspense } from 'react';\n\ninterface User {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n}\n\nasync function fetchUser(userId: string): Promise<User> {\n  const res = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);\n  if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch');\n  return res.json();\n}\n\ninterface UserProfileProps {\n  userId: string;\n}\n\nfunction UserProfile({ userId }: UserProfileProps) {\n  // React 19 'use' hook - unwraps promises\n  const user = use(fetchUser(userId));\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{user.name}</h1>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n// Wrap with Suspense boundary\nexport function UserProfileWithSuspense({ userId }: UserProfileProps) {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n      <UserProfile userId={userId} />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### Option 3: Client Component with useEffect (Legacy Pattern)\n\n```typescript\n'use client';\n\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\ninterface User {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n}\n\ninterface UseDataReturn<T> {\n  data: T | null;\n  loading: boolean;\n  error: string | null;\n}\n\nfunction useData<T>(url: string | null): UseDataReturn<T> {\n  const [data, setData] = useState<T | null>(null);\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (!url) return;\n\n    let ignore = false;\n    setLoading(true);\n\n    fetch(url)\n      .then(response => {\n        if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network error');\n        return response.json();\n      })\n      .then(json => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setData(json);\n          setError(null);\n        }\n      })\n      .catch(err => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setError(err instanceof Error ? err.message : 'An error occurred');\n        }\n      })\n      .finally(() => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setLoading(false);\n        }\n      });\n\n    return () => {\n      ignore = true;\n    };\n  }, [url]);\n\n  return { data, loading, error };\n}\n\n// Usage\nexport function UserProfile({ userId }: { userId: string }) {\n  const { data: user, loading, error } = useData<User>(`/api/users/${userId}`);\n\n  if (loading) return <Loading />;\n  if (error) return <Error message={error} />;\n  if (!user) return null;\n\n  return <div>{user.name}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### Context and State Management (TypeScript)\n\nImplement context with custom hooks for clean access:\n\n```typescript\n'use client';\n\nimport { createContext, useContext, useState, useCallback, useMemo, ReactNode } from 'react';\n\ninterface User {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  email: string;\n}\n\ninterface UserDispatch {\n  login: (userData: User) => void;\n  logout: () => void;\n}\n\nconst UserContext = createContext<User | null>(null);\nconst UserDispatchContext = createContext<UserDispatch | null>(null);\n\n// Custom hooks for context access\nexport function useUser() {\n  const context = useContext(UserContext);\n  if (context === null) {\n    throw new Error('useUser must be used within UserProvider');\n  }\n  return context;\n}\n\nexport function useUserDispatch() {\n  const context = useContext(UserDispatchContext);\n  if (context === null) {\n    throw new Error('useUserDispatch must be used within UserProvider');\n  }\n  return context;\n}\n\n// Provider component\nexport function UserProvider({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);\n\n  const login = useCallback((userData: User) => {\n    setUser(userData);\n  }, []);\n\n  const logout = useCallback(() => {\n    setUser(null);\n  }, []);\n\n  const dispatch = useMemo(() => ({ login, logout }), [login, logout]);\n\n  return (\n    <UserContext.Provider value={user}>\n      <UserDispatchContext.Provider value={dispatch}>\n        {children}\n      </UserDispatchContext.Provider>\n    </UserContext.Provider>\n  );\n}\n\n// Usage in components\nexport function UserMenu() {\n  const user = useUser();\n  const { logout } = useUserDispatch();\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <span>{user.name}</span>\n      <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### List Rendering with Keys\n\nAlways use proper keys for list items:\n\n```javascript\nfunction TodoList({ todos }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {todos.map(todo => (\n        <TodoItem\n          key={todo.id}  // Use stable, unique ID\n          todo={todo}\n        />\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n\n// Managing list state immutably\nfunction TodoApp() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    const newTodo = { id: crypto.randomUUID(), text, completed: false };\n    setTodos([...todos, newTodo]);\n  };\n\n  const toggleTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.map(todo =>\n      todo.id === id ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed } : todo\n    ));\n  };\n\n  const removeTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.filter(todo => todo.id !== id));\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <TodoInput onAdd={addTodo} />\n      <TodoList\n        todos={todos}\n        onToggle={toggleTodo}\n        onRemove={removeTodo}\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Critical Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n### 1. Never Call Hooks Conditionally\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Component({ isLoggedIn }) {\n  if (isLoggedIn) {\n    const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n  }\n  return <div>...</div>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Component({ isLoggedIn }) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n\n  if (!isLoggedIn) return <Login />;\n\n  return <div>{user.name}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Never Mutate State or Props\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction TodoList({ todos }) {\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    todos.push({ text }); // Mutation!\n    setTodos(todos);\n  };\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction TodoList() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    setTodos([...todos, { text }]); // New array\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Never Define Components Inside Components\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Parent() {\n  function Child() {  // Re-created every render!\n    return <div>Child</div>;\n  }\n  return <Child />;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Child() {\n  return <div>Child</div>;\n}\n\nfunction Parent() {\n  return <Child />;\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Never Pass Hooks as Props\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Button({ useData }) {\n  const data = useData(); // Don't pass hooks as props\n  return <button>{data}</button>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Button() {\n  const data = useData(); // Call hooks directly\n  return <button>{data}</button>;\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Don't Use Effect for Derived State\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Component({ firstName, lastName }) {\n  const [fullName, setFullName] = useState('');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    setFullName(`${firstName} ${lastName}`);\n  }, [firstName, lastName]);\n\n  return <div>{fullName}</div>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Component({ firstName, lastName }) {\n  const fullName = `${firstName} ${lastName}`; // Derive during render\n  return <div>{fullName}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\n### Measure Before Optimizing\n\nUse React DevTools Profiler to identify actual performance issues. Don't prematurely optimize.\n\n### Memoization Techniques\n\n```javascript\n// Memoize expensive computations\nfunction ProductList({ products, category }) {\n  const filteredProducts = useMemo(() => {\n    return products.filter(p => p.category === category);\n  }, [products, category]);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {filteredProducts.map(product => (\n        <Product key={product.id} product={product} />\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n// Memoize callbacks passed to children\nfunction Parent() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n    setCount(c => c + 1);\n  }, []);\n\n  return <MemoizedChild onClick={handleClick} />;\n}\n\n// Memoize components\nconst MemoizedChild = React.memo(function Child({ onClick }) {\n  return <button onClick={onClick}>Click me</button>;\n});\n```\n\n## Reference Documentation\n\nFor comprehensive details on React best practices, patterns, and anti-patterns, refer to:\n- `references/react_best_practices.md` -

This includes writing new React components, refactoring existing code, implementing React hooks, managing state, handling component lifecycle, optimizing performance, and following modern React best practices. The skill is particularly useful for tasks involving functional components, hooks patterns, custom hooks, and modern React features like concurrent rendering.\n---\n\n# React Component Creator\n\n## Overview\n\nThis skill provides comprehensive guidance for creating high-quality, production-ready React components following modern best practices. Use it when building new React components, refactoring existing code, implementing custom hooks, or optimizing React applications for performance and maintainability.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\nInvoke this skill for:\n- Creating new React functional components from scratch\n- Implementing React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.)\n- Building custom hooks for reusable logic\n- Refactoring class components to functional components\n- Optimizing component performance\n- Managing component state and lifecycle\n- Implementing proper data fetching patterns\n- Following React purity and immutability principles\n- Addressing React-specific bugs or anti-patterns\n\n## Core Principles\n\nBefore implementing any React component, adhere to these fundamental principles:\n\n1. **Components are pure functions** - Same props always produce the same output\n2. **Never mutate props or state** - Always create new objects/arrays\n3. **Hooks follow strict rules** - Top-level only, consistent order, no conditional calls\n4. **Components defined at module level** - Never create components inside other components\n5. **Immutability throughout** - No mutations after values are passed to JSX or hooks\n6. **TypeScript by default** - All components should use TypeScript for type safety\n7. **Server vs Client components** - In Next.js App Router, prefer Server Components by default; use \"use client\" directive only when needed\n\n## Component Creation Workflow\n\n### 1. Plan Component Structure\n\nBefore writing code, determine:\n- Is this a Server Component or Client Component? (Next.js App Router)\n- Is this a presentational or container component?\n- What props does it need? (Define TypeScript interface)\n- What local state is required?\n- What side effects need to be managed?\n- Are custom hooks needed for reusable logic?\n- Does it need error boundaries?\n\n### 2. Write the Component\n\nFollow this template structure for functional components:\n\n#### Client Component (TypeScript)\n\n```typescript\n'use client'; // Only if component uses hooks, browser APIs, or event handlers\n\nimport { useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo } from 'react';\n\ninterface ComponentNameProps {\n  prop1: string;\n  prop2: number;\n}\n\nexport function ComponentName({ prop1, prop2 }: ComponentNameProps) {\n  // 1. All hooks at the top level (never conditional)\n  const [state, setState] = useState<string>(initialValue);\n  const contextValue = useContext(SomeContext);\n\n  // 2. Derived values and memoization\n  const derivedValue = useMemo(() => {\n    return expensiveComputation(prop1, prop2);\n  }, [prop1, prop2]);\n\n  // 3. Event handlers and callbacks\n  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n    setState(newValue);\n  }, []);\n\n  // 4. Effects (for synchronization only)\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // Setup\n    const subscription = subscribe();\n\n    // Cleanup\n    return () => subscription.unsubscribe();\n  }, [dependencies]);\n\n  // 5. Early returns (after all hooks)\n  if (loading) return <Loading />;\n  if (error) return <Error message={error} />;\n\n  // 6. Render JSX\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>\n        {derivedValue}\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### Server Component (TypeScript - Next.js App Router)\n\n```typescript\n// No 'use client' directive - Server Component by default\n\ninterface UserProfileProps {\n  userId: string;\n}\n\nexport async function UserProfile({ userId }: UserProfileProps) {\n  // Server Components can be async and fetch data directly\n  const user = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`)\n    .then(res => res.json());\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{user.name}</h1>\n      <p>{user.email}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Validate Against Best Practices\n\nCheck the component against these criteria:\n- All hooks are called at the top level\n- No hooks after early returns or in conditionals\n- State is never mutated directly\n- Dependencies in useEffect/useCallback/useMemo are complete\n- Event handlers are properly defined\n- Props are not mutated\n- Component is defined at module level (not inside another component)\n\n### 4. Optimize if Needed\n\nApply optimizations only after measuring performance:\n- Wrap expensive computations in `useMemo`\n- Wrap callback functions in `useCallback` when passed to memoized children\n- Use `React.memo` for components that re-render unnecessarily\n- Consider code splitting for large components\n\n## Next.js App Router Specifics\n\n### Server vs Client Components\n\n**Server Components (Default):**\n- No \"use client\" directive needed\n- Can be async functions\n- Can fetch data directly with await\n- Rendered on the server\n- Cannot use hooks, event handlers, or browser APIs\n- Smaller JavaScript bundle\n\n**Client Components:**\n- Require \"use client\" directive at the top of the file\n- Can use hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)\n- Can use event handlers (onClick, onChange, etc.)\n- Can access browser APIs (window, localStorage, etc.)\n- Rendered on both server (initial) and client (hydration)\n\n```typescript\n// Server Component - prefer by default\nexport async function BlogPost({ slug }: { slug: string }) {\n  const post = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/posts/${slug}`)\n    .then(res => res.json());\n\n  return <article>{post.content}</article>;\n}\n\n// Client Component - only when needed\n'use client';\n\nexport function LikeButton({ postId }: { postId: string }) {\n  const [liked, setLiked] = useState(false);\n\n  return (\n    <button onClick={() => setLiked(!liked)}>\n      {liked ? '❤️' : '🤍'}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Composition Pattern\n\nCombine Server and Client Components effectively:\n\n```typescript\n// app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx (Server Component)\nimport { LikeButton } from '@/components/LikeButton';\n\nexport default async function BlogPage({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {\n  const post = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/posts/${params.slug}`)\n    .then(res => res.json());\n\n  return (\n    <article>\n      <h1>{post.title}</h1>\n      <div>{post.content}</div>\n      <LikeButton postId={post.id} /> {/* Client Component */}\n    </article>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Common Tasks\n\n### Creating a Form Component (TypeScript)\n\n```typescript\n'use client';\n\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\ninterface LoginFormProps {\n  onSuccess?: () => void;\n}\n\nexport function LoginForm({ onSuccess }: LoginFormProps) {\n  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');\n  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');\n  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);\n  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    setError(null);\n    setIsLoading(true);\n\n    try {\n      await login(email, password);\n      onSuccess?.();\n    } catch (err) {\n      setError(err instanceof Error ? err.message : 'Login failed');\n    } finally {\n      setIsLoading(false);\n    }\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      <input\n        type=\"email\"\n        value={email}\n        onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}\n        disabled={isLoading}\n        required\n      />\n      <input\n        type=\"password\"\n        value={password}\n        onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}\n        disabled={isLoading}\n        required\n      />\n      {error && <div className=\"error\">{error}</div>}\n      <button type=\"submit\" disabled={isLoading}>\n        {isLoading ? 'Logging in...' : 'Login'}\n      </button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Creating a Custom Hook (TypeScript)\n\nExtract reusable logic into custom hooks. Always prefix with \"use\":\n\n```typescript\n'use client';\n\nimport { useState, useCallback, ChangeEvent } from 'react';\n\ninterface UseFormInputReturn {\n  value: string;\n  onChange: (e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => void;\n  reset: () => void;\n}\n\nfunction useFormInput(initialValue: string): UseFormInputReturn {\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);\n\n  const handleChange = useCallback((e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {\n    setValue(e.target.value);\n  }, []);\n\n  const reset = useCallback(() => {\n    setValue(initialValue);\n  }, [initialValue]);\n\n  return {\n    value,\n    onChange: handleChange,\n    reset\n  };\n}\n\n// Usage in component\nexport function RegistrationForm() {\n  const emailInput = useFormInput('');\n  const passwordInput = useFormInput('');\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <input type=\"email\" {...emailInput} />\n      <input type=\"password\" {...passwordInput} />\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Data Fetching Patterns\n\n#### Option 1: Server Component (Preferred for Next.js App Router)\n\n```typescript\n// No 'use client' - Server Component\ninterface User {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  email: string;\n}\n\ninterface UserProfileProps {\n  userId: string;\n}\n\nexport async function UserProfile({ userId }: UserProfileProps) {\n  // Direct async/await in Server Component\n  const user: User = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`, {\n    next: { revalidate: 3600 } // Cache for 1 hour\n  }).then(res => {\n    if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch user');\n    return res.json();\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{user.name}</h1>\n      <p>{user.email}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### Option 2: Client Component with `use` Hook (React 19)\n\n```typescript\n'use client';\n\nimport { use, Suspense } from 'react';\n\ninterface User {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n}\n\nasync function fetchUser(userId: string): Promise<User> {\n  const res = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);\n  if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch');\n  return res.json();\n}\n\ninterface UserProfileProps {\n  userId: string;\n}\n\nfunction UserProfile({ userId }: UserProfileProps) {\n  // React 19 'use' hook - unwraps promises\n  const user = use(fetchUser(userId));\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{user.name}</h1>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n// Wrap with Suspense boundary\nexport function UserProfileWithSuspense({ userId }: UserProfileProps) {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n      <UserProfile userId={userId} />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### Option 3: Client Component with useEffect (Legacy Pattern)\n\n```typescript\n'use client';\n\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\ninterface User {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n}\n\ninterface UseDataReturn<T> {\n  data: T | null;\n  loading: boolean;\n  error: string | null;\n}\n\nfunction useData<T>(url: string | null): UseDataReturn<T> {\n  const [data, setData] = useState<T | null>(null);\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (!url) return;\n\n    let ignore = false;\n    setLoading(true);\n\n    fetch(url)\n      .then(response => {\n        if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network error');\n        return response.json();\n      })\n      .then(json => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setData(json);\n          setError(null);\n        }\n      })\n      .catch(err => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setError(err instanceof Error ? err.message : 'An error occurred');\n        }\n      })\n      .finally(() => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setLoading(false);\n        }\n      });\n\n    return () => {\n      ignore = true;\n    };\n  }, [url]);\n\n  return { data, loading, error };\n}\n\n// Usage\nexport function UserProfile({ userId }: { userId: string }) {\n  const { data: user, loading, error } = useData<User>(`/api/users/${userId}`);\n\n  if (loading) return <Loading />;\n  if (error) return <Error message={error} />;\n  if (!user) return null;\n\n  return <div>{user.name}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### Context and State Management (TypeScript)\n\nImplement context with custom hooks for clean access:\n\n```typescript\n'use client';\n\nimport { createContext, useContext, useState, useCallback, useMemo, ReactNode } from 'react';\n\ninterface User {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  email: string;\n}\n\ninterface UserDispatch {\n  login: (userData: User) => void;\n  logout: () => void;\n}\n\nconst UserContext = createContext<User | null>(null);\nconst UserDispatchContext = createContext<UserDispatch | null>(null);\n\n// Custom hooks for context access\nexport function useUser() {\n  const context = useContext(UserContext);\n  if (context === null) {\n    throw new Error('useUser must be used within UserProvider');\n  }\n  return context;\n}\n\nexport function useUserDispatch() {\n  const context = useContext(UserDispatchContext);\n  if (context === null) {\n    throw new Error('useUserDispatch must be used within UserProvider');\n  }\n  return context;\n}\n\n// Provider component\nexport function UserProvider({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);\n\n  const login = useCallback((userData: User) => {\n    setUser(userData);\n  }, []);\n\n  const logout = useCallback(() => {\n    setUser(null);\n  }, []);\n\n  const dispatch = useMemo(() => ({ login, logout }), [login, logout]);\n\n  return (\n    <UserContext.Provider value={user}>\n      <UserDispatchContext.Provider value={dispatch}>\n        {children}\n      </UserDispatchContext.Provider>\n    </UserContext.Provider>\n  );\n}\n\n// Usage in components\nexport function UserMenu() {\n  const user = useUser();\n  const { logout } = useUserDispatch();\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <span>{user.name}</span>\n      <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### List Rendering with Keys\n\nAlways use proper keys for list items:\n\n```javascript\nfunction TodoList({ todos }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {todos.map(todo => (\n        <TodoItem\n          key={todo.id}  // Use stable, unique ID\n          todo={todo}\n        />\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n\n// Managing list state immutably\nfunction TodoApp() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    const newTodo = { id: crypto.randomUUID(), text, completed: false };\n    setTodos([...todos, newTodo]);\n  };\n\n  const toggleTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.map(todo =>\n      todo.id === id ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed } : todo\n    ));\n  };\n\n  const removeTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.filter(todo => todo.id !== id));\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <TodoInput onAdd={addTodo} />\n      <TodoList\n        todos={todos}\n        onToggle={toggleTodo}\n        onRemove={removeTodo}\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Error Handling\n\n#### Error Boundaries (Class Component - Required for now)\n\n```typescript\n'use client';\n\nimport { Component, ReactNode, ErrorInfo } from 'react';\n\ninterface Props {\n  children: ReactNode;\n  fallback?: ReactNode;\n}\n\ninterface State {\n  hasError: boolean;\n  error?: Error;\n}\n\nexport class ErrorBoundary extends Component<Props, State> {\n  constructor(props: Props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = { hasError: false };\n  }\n\n  static getDerivedStateFromError(error: Error): State {\n    return { hasError: true, error };\n  }\n\n  componentDidCatch(error: Error, errorInfo: ErrorInfo) {\n    console.error('Error caught by boundary:', error, errorInfo);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    if (this.state.hasError) {\n      return this.props.fallback || (\n        <div role=\"alert\">\n          <h2>Something went wrong</h2>\n          <p>{this.state.error?.message}</p>\n        </div>\n      );\n    }\n\n    return this.props.children;\n  }\n}\n\n// Usage\nexport function App() {\n  return (\n    <ErrorBoundary fallback={<ErrorFallback />}>\n      <MyComponent />\n    </ErrorBoundary>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### Throwing Errors in Render (React 19 Pattern)\n\n```typescript\n// Server Component - can throw directly\nexport async function UserProfile({ userId }: { userId: string }) {\n  const res = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);\n\n  if (!res.ok) {\n    // Throwing in Server Component will be caught by nearest error.tsx\n    throw new Error('Failed to load user');\n  }\n\n  const user = await res.json();\n  return <div>{user.name}</div>;\n}\n\n// Client Component with use hook - errors caught by Suspense boundary\n'use client';\n\nimport { use, Suspense } from 'react';\n\nfunction UserProfile({ userPromise }: { userPromise: Promise<User> }) {\n  const user = use(userPromise); // Errors throw and bubble up\n  return <div>{user.name}</div>;\n}\n\nexport function UserProfileWrapper({ userId }: { userId: string }) {\n  const userPromise = fetchUser(userId);\n\n  return (\n    <ErrorBoundary>\n      <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n        <UserProfile userPromise={userPromise} />\n      </Suspense>\n    </ErrorBoundary>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Testing Components\n\n#### Vitest + Testing Library Setup\n\n```typescript\n// Button.test.tsx\nimport { describe, it, expect, vi } from 'vitest';\nimport { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport { Button } from './Button';\n\ndescribe('Button', () => {\n  it('renders with correct text', () => {\n    render(<Button>Click me</Button>);\n    expect(screen.getByRole('button')).toHaveTextContent('Click me');\n  });\n\n  it('calls onClick when clicked', () => {\n    const handleClick = vi.fn();\n    render(<Button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</Button>);\n\n    fireEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button'));\n    expect(handleClick).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);\n  });\n\n  it('is disabled when disabled prop is true', () => {\n    render(<Button disabled>Click me</Button>);\n    expect(screen.getByRole('button')).toBeDisabled();\n  });\n});\n```\n\n#### Testing Custom Hooks\n\n```typescript\n// useCounter.test.ts\nimport { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';\nimport { renderHook, act } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport { useCounter } from './useCounter';\n\ndescribe('useCounter', () => {\n  it('initializes with default value', () => {\n    const { result } = renderHook(() => useCounter(0));\n    expect(result.current.count).toBe(0);\n  });\n\n  it('increments counter', () => {\n    const { result } = renderHook(() => useCounter(0));\n\n    act(() => {\n      result.current.increment();\n    });\n\n    expect(result.current.count).toBe(1);\n  });\n\n  it('decrements counter', () => {\n    const { result } = renderHook(() => useCounter(5));\n\n    act(() => {\n      result.current.decrement();\n    });\n\n    expect(result.current.count).toBe(4);\n  });\n});\n```\n\n#### Testing Components with Context\n\n```typescript\n// UserMenu.test.tsx\nimport { describe, it, expect, vi } from 'vitest';\nimport { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport { UserProvider } from './UserContext';\nimport { UserMenu } from './UserMenu';\n\ndescribe('UserMenu', () => {\n  it('displays user name', () => {\n    const mockUser = { id: '1', name: 'John Doe', email: 'john@example.com' };\n\n    render(\n      <UserProvider initialUser={mockUser}>\n        <UserMenu />\n      </UserProvider>\n    );\n\n    expect(screen.getByText('John Doe')).toBeInTheDocument();\n  });\n\n  it('calls logout when logout button clicked', () => {\n    const mockLogout = vi.fn();\n\n    render(\n      <UserProvider onLogout={mockLogout}>\n        <UserMenu />\n      </UserProvider>\n    );\n\n    fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Logout'));\n    expect(mockLogout).toHaveBeenCalled();\n  });\n});\n```\n\n#### Testing Async Components (Server Components)\n\n```typescript\n// UserProfile.test.tsx\nimport { describe, it, expect, vi } from 'vitest';\nimport { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport { UserProfile } from './UserProfile';\n\n// Mock fetch\nglobal.fetch = vi.fn();\n\ndescribe('UserProfile', () => {\n  it('renders user data', async () => {\n    const mockUser = { id: '1', name: 'Jane Doe', email: 'jane@example.com' };\n\n    (global.fetch as any).mockResolvedValueOnce({\n      ok: true,\n      json: async () => mockUser,\n    });\n\n    render(await UserProfile({ userId: '1' }));\n\n    expect(screen.getByText('Jane Doe')).toBeInTheDocument();\n    expect(screen.getByText('jane@example.com')).toBeInTheDocument();\n  });\n\n  it('handles fetch errors', async () => {\n    (global.fetch as any).mockResolvedValueOnce({\n      ok: false,\n    });\n\n    await expect(async () => {\n      render(await UserProfile({ userId: '1' }));\n    }).rejects.toThrow('Failed to fetch user');\n  });\n});\n```\n\n## Critical Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n### 1. Never Call Hooks Conditionally\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Component({ isLoggedIn }) {\n  if (isLoggedIn) {\n    const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n  }\n  return <div>...</div>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Component({ isLoggedIn }) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n\n  if (!isLoggedIn) return <Login />;\n\n  return <div>{user.name}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Never Mutate State or Props\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction TodoList({ todos }) {\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    todos.push({ text }); // Mutation!\n    setTodos(todos);\n  };\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction TodoList() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    setTodos([...todos, { text }]); // New array\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Never Define Components Inside Components\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Parent() {\n  function Child() {  // Re-created every render!\n    return <div>Child</div>;\n  }\n  return <Child />;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Child() {\n  return <div>Child</div>;\n}\n\nfunction Parent() {\n  return <Child />;\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Never Pass Hooks as Props\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Button({ useData }) {\n  const data = useData(); // Don't pass hooks as props\n  return <button>{data}</button>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Button() {\n  const data = useData(); // Call hooks directly\n  return <button>{data}</button>;\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Don't Use Effect for Derived State\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Component({ firstName, lastName }) {\n  const [fullName, setFullName] = useState('');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    setFullName(`${firstName} ${lastName}`);\n  }, [firstName, lastName]);\n\n  return <div>{fullName}</div>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Component({ firstName, lastName }) {\n  const fullName = `${firstName} ${lastName}`; // Derive during render\n  return <div>{fullName}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\n### Measure Before Optimizing\n\nUse React DevTools Profiler to identify actual performance issues. Don't prematurely optimize.\n\n### Memoization Techniques\n\n```javascript\n// Memoize expensive computations\nfunction ProductList({ products, category }) {\n  const filteredProducts = useMemo(() => {\n    return products.filter(p => p.category === category);\n  }, [products, category]);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {filteredProducts.map(product => (\n        <Product key={product.id} product={product} />\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n// Memoize callbacks passed to children\nfunction Parent() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n    setCount(c => c + 1);\n  }, []);\n\n  return <MemoizedChild onClick={handleClick} />;\n}\n\n// Memoize components\nconst MemoizedChild = React.memo(function Child({ onClick }) {\n  return <button onClick={onClick}>Click me</button>;\n});\n```\n\n## Reference Documentation\n\nFor comprehensive details on React best practices, patterns, and anti-patterns, refer to:\n- `references/react_best_practices.md` -

This includes writing new React components, refactoring existing code, implementing React hooks, managing state, handling component lifecycle, optimizing performance, and following modern React best practices. The skill is particularly useful for tasks involving functional components, hooks patterns, custom hooks, and modern React features like concurrent rendering.\n---\n\n# React Component Creator\n\n## Overview\n\nThis skill provides comprehensive guidance for creating high-quality, production-ready React components following modern best practices. Use it when building new React components, refactoring existing code, implementing custom hooks, or optimizing React applications for performance and maintainability.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\nInvoke this skill for:\n- Creating new React functional components from scratch\n- Implementing React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.)\n- Building custom hooks for reusable logic\n- Refactoring class components to functional components\n- Optimizing component performance\n- Managing component state and lifecycle\n- Implementing proper data fetching patterns\n- Following React purity and immutability principles\n- Addressing React-specific bugs or anti-patterns\n\n## Core Principles\n\nBefore implementing any React component, adhere to these fundamental principles:\n\n1. **Components are pure functions** - Same props always produce the same output\n2. **Never mutate props or state** - Always create new objects/arrays\n3. **Hooks follow strict rules** - Top-level only, consistent order, no conditional calls\n4. **Components defined at module level** - Never create components inside other components\n5. **Immutability throughout** - No mutations after values are passed to JSX or hooks\n6. **TypeScript by default** - All components should use TypeScript for type safety\n7. **Server vs Client components** - In Next.js App Router, prefer Server Components by default; use \"use client\" directive only when needed\n\n## Component Creation Workflow\n\n### 1. Plan Component Structure\n\nBefore writing code, determine:\n- Is this a Server Component or Client Component? (Next.js App Router)\n- Is this a presentational or container component?\n- What props does it need? (Define TypeScript interface)\n- What local state is required?\n- What side effects need to be managed?\n- Are custom hooks needed for reusable logic?\n- Does it need error boundaries?\n\n### 2. Write the Component\n\nFollow this template structure for functional components:\n\n#### Client Component (TypeScript)\n\n```typescript\n'use client'; // Only if component uses hooks, browser APIs, or event handlers\n\nimport { useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo } from 'react';\n\ninterface ComponentNameProps {\n  prop1: string;\n  prop2: number;\n}\n\nexport function ComponentName({ prop1, prop2 }: ComponentNameProps) {\n  // 1. All hooks at the top level (never conditional)\n  const [state, setState] = useState<string>(initialValue);\n  const contextValue = useContext(SomeContext);\n\n  // 2. Derived values and memoization\n  const derivedValue = useMemo(() => {\n    return expensiveComputation(prop1, prop2);\n  }, [prop1, prop2]);\n\n  // 3. Event handlers and callbacks\n  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n    setState(newValue);\n  }, []);\n\n  // 4. Effects (for synchronization only)\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // Setup\n    const subscription = subscribe();\n\n    // Cleanup\n    return () => subscription.unsubscribe();\n  }, [dependencies]);\n\n  // 5. Early returns (after all hooks)\n  if (loading) return <Loading />;\n  if (error) return <Error message={error} />;\n\n  // 6. Render JSX\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>\n        {derivedValue}\n      </button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### Server Component (TypeScript - Next.js App Router)\n\n```typescript\n// No 'use client' directive - Server Component by default\n\ninterface UserProfileProps {\n  userId: string;\n}\n\nexport async function UserProfile({ userId }: UserProfileProps) {\n  // Server Components can be async and fetch data directly\n  const user = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`)\n    .then(res => res.json());\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{user.name}</h1>\n      <p>{user.email}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Validate Against Best Practices\n\nCheck the component against these criteria:\n- All hooks are called at the top level\n- No hooks after early returns or in conditionals\n- State is never mutated directly\n- Dependencies in useEffect/useCallback/useMemo are complete\n- Event handlers are properly defined\n- Props are not mutated\n- Component is defined at module level (not inside another component)\n\n### 4. Optimize if Needed\n\nApply optimizations only after measuring performance:\n- Wrap expensive computations in `useMemo`\n- Wrap callback functions in `useCallback` when passed to memoized children\n- Use `React.memo` for components that re-render unnecessarily\n- Consider code splitting for large components\n\n## Next.js App Router Specifics\n\n### Server vs Client Components\n\n**Server Components (Default):**\n- No \"use client\" directive needed\n- Can be async functions\n- Can fetch data directly with await\n- Rendered on the server\n- Cannot use hooks, event handlers, or browser APIs\n- Smaller JavaScript bundle\n\n**Client Components:**\n- Require \"use client\" directive at the top of the file\n- Can use hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)\n- Can use event handlers (onClick, onChange, etc.)\n- Can access browser APIs (window, localStorage, etc.)\n- Rendered on both server (initial) and client (hydration)\n\n```typescript\n// Server Component - prefer by default\nexport async function BlogPost({ slug }: { slug: string }) {\n  const post = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/posts/${slug}`)\n    .then(res => res.json());\n\n  return <article>{post.content}</article>;\n}\n\n// Client Component - only when needed\n'use client';\n\nexport function LikeButton({ postId }: { postId: string }) {\n  const [liked, setLiked] = useState(false);\n\n  return (\n    <button onClick={() => setLiked(!liked)}>\n      {liked ? '❤️' : '🤍'}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Composition Pattern\n\nCombine Server and Client Components effectively:\n\n```typescript\n// app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx (Server Component)\nimport { LikeButton } from '@/components/LikeButton';\n\nexport default async function BlogPage({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {\n  const post = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/posts/${params.slug}`)\n    .then(res => res.json());\n\n  return (\n    <article>\n      <h1>{post.title}</h1>\n      <div>{post.content}</div>\n      <LikeButton postId={post.id} /> {/* Client Component */}\n    </article>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Common Tasks\n\n### Creating a Form Component (TypeScript)\n\n```typescript\n'use client';\n\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\ninterface LoginFormProps {\n  onSuccess?: () => void;\n}\n\nexport function LoginForm({ onSuccess }: LoginFormProps) {\n  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');\n  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');\n  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);\n  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {\n    e.preventDefault();\n    setError(null);\n    setIsLoading(true);\n\n    try {\n      await login(email, password);\n      onSuccess?.();\n    } catch (err) {\n      setError(err instanceof Error ? err.message : 'Login failed');\n    } finally {\n      setIsLoading(false);\n    }\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      <input\n        type=\"email\"\n        value={email}\n        onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}\n        disabled={isLoading}\n        required\n      />\n      <input\n        type=\"password\"\n        value={password}\n        onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)}\n        disabled={isLoading}\n        required\n      />\n      {error && <div className=\"error\">{error}</div>}\n      <button type=\"submit\" disabled={isLoading}>\n        {isLoading ? 'Logging in...' : 'Login'}\n      </button>\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Creating a Custom Hook (TypeScript)\n\nExtract reusable logic into custom hooks. Always prefix with \"use\":\n\n```typescript\n'use client';\n\nimport { useState, useCallback, ChangeEvent } from 'react';\n\ninterface UseFormInputReturn {\n  value: string;\n  onChange: (e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => void;\n  reset: () => void;\n}\n\nfunction useFormInput(initialValue: string): UseFormInputReturn {\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);\n\n  const handleChange = useCallback((e: ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {\n    setValue(e.target.value);\n  }, []);\n\n  const reset = useCallback(() => {\n    setValue(initialValue);\n  }, [initialValue]);\n\n  return {\n    value,\n    onChange: handleChange,\n    reset\n  };\n}\n\n// Usage in component\nexport function RegistrationForm() {\n  const emailInput = useFormInput('');\n  const passwordInput = useFormInput('');\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <input type=\"email\" {...emailInput} />\n      <input type=\"password\" {...passwordInput} />\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Data Fetching Patterns\n\n#### Option 1: Server Component (Preferred for Next.js App Router)\n\n```typescript\n// No 'use client' - Server Component\ninterface User {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  email: string;\n}\n\ninterface UserProfileProps {\n  userId: string;\n}\n\nexport async function UserProfile({ userId }: UserProfileProps) {\n  // Direct async/await in Server Component\n  const user: User = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`, {\n    next: { revalidate: 3600 } // Cache for 1 hour\n  }).then(res => {\n    if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch user');\n    return res.json();\n  });\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{user.name}</h1>\n      <p>{user.email}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### Option 2: Client Component with `use` Hook (React 19)\n\n```typescript\n'use client';\n\nimport { use, Suspense } from 'react';\n\ninterface User {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n}\n\nasync function fetchUser(userId: string): Promise<User> {\n  const res = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);\n  if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch');\n  return res.json();\n}\n\ninterface UserProfileProps {\n  userId: string;\n}\n\nfunction UserProfile({ userId }: UserProfileProps) {\n  // React 19 'use' hook - unwraps promises\n  const user = use(fetchUser(userId));\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{user.name}</h1>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n// Wrap with Suspense boundary\nexport function UserProfileWithSuspense({ userId }: UserProfileProps) {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n      <UserProfile userId={userId} />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### Option 3: Client Component with useEffect (Legacy Pattern)\n\n```typescript\n'use client';\n\nimport { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\n\ninterface User {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n}\n\ninterface UseDataReturn<T> {\n  data: T | null;\n  loading: boolean;\n  error: string | null;\n}\n\nfunction useData<T>(url: string | null): UseDataReturn<T> {\n  const [data, setData] = useState<T | null>(null);\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);\n  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (!url) return;\n\n    let ignore = false;\n    setLoading(true);\n\n    fetch(url)\n      .then(response => {\n        if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network error');\n        return response.json();\n      })\n      .then(json => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setData(json);\n          setError(null);\n        }\n      })\n      .catch(err => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setError(err instanceof Error ? err.message : 'An error occurred');\n        }\n      })\n      .finally(() => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setLoading(false);\n        }\n      });\n\n    return () => {\n      ignore = true;\n    };\n  }, [url]);\n\n  return { data, loading, error };\n}\n\n// Usage\nexport function UserProfile({ userId }: { userId: string }) {\n  const { data: user, loading, error } = useData<User>(`/api/users/${userId}`);\n\n  if (loading) return <Loading />;\n  if (error) return <Error message={error} />;\n  if (!user) return null;\n\n  return <div>{user.name}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### Context and State Management (TypeScript)\n\nImplement context with custom hooks for clean access:\n\n```typescript\n'use client';\n\nimport { createContext, useContext, useState, useCallback, useMemo, ReactNode } from 'react';\n\ninterface User {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  email: string;\n}\n\ninterface UserDispatch {\n  login: (userData: User) => void;\n  logout: () => void;\n}\n\nconst UserContext = createContext<User | null>(null);\nconst UserDispatchContext = createContext<UserDispatch | null>(null);\n\n// Custom hooks for context access\nexport function useUser() {\n  const context = useContext(UserContext);\n  if (context === null) {\n    throw new Error('useUser must be used within UserProvider');\n  }\n  return context;\n}\n\nexport function useUserDispatch() {\n  const context = useContext(UserDispatchContext);\n  if (context === null) {\n    throw new Error('useUserDispatch must be used within UserProvider');\n  }\n  return context;\n}\n\n// Provider component\nexport function UserProvider({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);\n\n  const login = useCallback((userData: User) => {\n    setUser(userData);\n  }, []);\n\n  const logout = useCallback(() => {\n    setUser(null);\n  }, []);\n\n  const dispatch = useMemo(() => ({ login, logout }), [login, logout]);\n\n  return (\n    <UserContext.Provider value={user}>\n      <UserDispatchContext.Provider value={dispatch}>\n        {children}\n      </UserDispatchContext.Provider>\n    </UserContext.Provider>\n  );\n}\n\n// Usage in components\nexport function UserMenu() {\n  const user = useUser();\n  const { logout } = useUserDispatch();\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <span>{user.name}</span>\n      <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### List Rendering with Keys\n\nAlways use proper keys for list items:\n\n```javascript\nfunction TodoList({ todos }) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {todos.map(todo => (\n        <TodoItem\n          key={todo.id}  // Use stable, unique ID\n          todo={todo}\n        />\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n\n// Managing list state immutably\nfunction TodoApp() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    const newTodo = { id: crypto.randomUUID(), text, completed: false };\n    setTodos([...todos, newTodo]);\n  };\n\n  const toggleTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.map(todo =>\n      todo.id === id ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed } : todo\n    ));\n  };\n\n  const removeTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.filter(todo => todo.id !== id));\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <TodoInput onAdd={addTodo} />\n      <TodoList\n        todos={todos}\n        onToggle={toggleTodo}\n        onRemove={removeTodo}\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Error Handling\n\n#### Error Boundaries (Class Component - Required for now)\n\n```typescript\n'use client';\n\nimport { Component, ReactNode, ErrorInfo } from 'react';\n\ninterface Props {\n  children: ReactNode;\n  fallback?: ReactNode;\n}\n\ninterface State {\n  hasError: boolean;\n  error?: Error;\n}\n\nexport class ErrorBoundary extends Component<Props, State> {\n  constructor(props: Props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = { hasError: false };\n  }\n\n  static getDerivedStateFromError(error: Error): State {\n    return { hasError: true, error };\n  }\n\n  componentDidCatch(error: Error, errorInfo: ErrorInfo) {\n    console.error('Error caught by boundary:', error, errorInfo);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    if (this.state.hasError) {\n      return this.props.fallback || (\n        <div role=\"alert\">\n          <h2>Something went wrong</h2>\n          <p>{this.state.error?.message}</p>\n        </div>\n      );\n    }\n\n    return this.props.children;\n  }\n}\n\n// Usage\nexport function App() {\n  return (\n    <ErrorBoundary fallback={<ErrorFallback />}>\n      <MyComponent />\n    </ErrorBoundary>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n#### Throwing Errors in Render (React 19 Pattern)\n\n```typescript\n// Server Component - can throw directly\nexport async function UserProfile({ userId }: { userId: string }) {\n  const res = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);\n\n  if (!res.ok) {\n    // Throwing in Server Component will be caught by nearest error.tsx\n    throw new Error('Failed to load user');\n  }\n\n  const user = await res.json();\n  return <div>{user.name}</div>;\n}\n\n// Client Component with use hook - errors caught by Suspense boundary\n'use client';\n\nimport { use, Suspense } from 'react';\n\nfunction UserProfile({ userPromise }: { userPromise: Promise<User> }) {\n  const user = use(userPromise); // Errors throw and bubble up\n  return <div>{user.name}</div>;\n}\n\nexport function UserProfileWrapper({ userId }: { userId: string }) {\n  const userPromise = fetchUser(userId);\n\n  return (\n    <ErrorBoundary>\n      <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n        <UserProfile userPromise={userPromise} />\n      </Suspense>\n    </ErrorBoundary>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Testing Components\n\n#### Vitest + Testing Library Setup\n\n```typescript\n// Button.test.tsx\nimport { describe, it, expect, vi } from 'vitest';\nimport { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport { Button } from './Button';\n\ndescribe('Button', () => {\n  it('renders with correct text', () => {\n    render(<Button>Click me</Button>);\n    expect(screen.getByRole('button')).toHaveTextContent('Click me');\n  });\n\n  it('calls onClick when clicked', () => {\n    const handleClick = vi.fn();\n    render(<Button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</Button>);\n\n    fireEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button'));\n    expect(handleClick).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);\n  });\n\n  it('is disabled when disabled prop is true', () => {\n    render(<Button disabled>Click me</Button>);\n    expect(screen.getByRole('button')).toBeDisabled();\n  });\n});\n```\n\n#### Testing Custom Hooks\n\n```typescript\n// useCounter.test.ts\nimport { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';\nimport { renderHook, act } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport { useCounter } from './useCounter';\n\ndescribe('useCounter', () => {\n  it('initializes with default value', () => {\n    const { result } = renderHook(() => useCounter(0));\n    expect(result.current.count).toBe(0);\n  });\n\n  it('increments counter', () => {\n    const { result } = renderHook(() => useCounter(0));\n\n    act(() => {\n      result.current.increment();\n    });\n\n    expect(result.current.count).toBe(1);\n  });\n\n  it('decrements counter', () => {\n    const { result } = renderHook(() => useCounter(5));\n\n    act(() => {\n      result.current.decrement();\n    });\n\n    expect(result.current.count).toBe(4);\n  });\n});\n```\n\n#### Testing Components with Context\n\n```typescript\n// UserMenu.test.tsx\nimport { describe, it, expect, vi } from 'vitest';\nimport { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport { UserProvider } from './UserContext';\nimport { UserMenu } from './UserMenu';\n\ndescribe('UserMenu', () => {\n  it('displays user name', () => {\n    const mockUser = { id: '1', name: 'John Doe', email: 'john@example.com' };\n\n    render(\n      <UserProvider initialUser={mockUser}>\n        <UserMenu />\n      </UserProvider>\n    );\n\n    expect(screen.getByText('John Doe')).toBeInTheDocument();\n  });\n\n  it('calls logout when logout button clicked', () => {\n    const mockLogout = vi.fn();\n\n    render(\n      <UserProvider onLogout={mockLogout}>\n        <UserMenu />\n      </UserProvider>\n    );\n\n    fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Logout'));\n    expect(mockLogout).toHaveBeenCalled();\n  });\n});\n```\n\n#### Testing Async Components (Server Components)\n\n```typescript\n// UserProfile.test.tsx\nimport { describe, it, expect, vi } from 'vitest';\nimport { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport { UserProfile } from './UserProfile';\n\n// Mock fetch\nglobal.fetch = vi.fn();\n\ndescribe('UserProfile', () => {\n  it('renders user data', async () => {\n    const mockUser = { id: '1', name: 'Jane Doe', email: 'jane@example.com' };\n\n    (global.fetch as any).mockResolvedValueOnce({\n      ok: true,\n      json: async () => mockUser,\n    });\n\n    render(await UserProfile({ userId: '1' }));\n\n    expect(screen.getByText('Jane Doe')).toBeInTheDocument();\n    expect(screen.getByText('jane@example.com')).toBeInTheDocument();\n  });\n\n  it('handles fetch errors', async () => {\n    (global.fetch as any).mockResolvedValueOnce({\n      ok: false,\n    });\n\n    await expect(async () => {\n      render(await UserProfile({ userId: '1' }));\n    }).rejects.toThrow('Failed to fetch user');\n  });\n});\n```\n\n## Critical Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n### 1. Never Call Hooks Conditionally\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Component({ isLoggedIn }) {\n  if (isLoggedIn) {\n    const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n  }\n  return <div>...</div>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Component({ isLoggedIn }) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);\n\n  if (!isLoggedIn) return <Login />;\n\n  return <div>{user.name}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Never Mutate State or Props\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction TodoList({ todos }) {\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    todos.push({ text }); // Mutation!\n    setTodos(todos);\n  };\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction TodoList() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    setTodos([...todos, { text }]); // New array\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Never Define Components Inside Components\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Parent() {\n  function Child() {  // Re-created every render!\n    return <div>Child</div>;\n  }\n  return <Child />;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Child() {\n  return <div>Child</div>;\n}\n\nfunction Parent() {\n  return <Child />;\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Never Pass Hooks as Props\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Button({ useData }) {\n  const data = useData(); // Don't pass hooks as props\n  return <button>{data}</button>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Button() {\n  const data = useData(); // Call hooks directly\n  return <button>{data}</button>;\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Don't Use Effect for Derived State\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ WRONG\nfunction Component({ firstName, lastName }) {\n  const [fullName, setFullName] = useState('');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    setFullName(`${firstName} ${lastName}`);\n  }, [firstName, lastName]);\n\n  return <div>{fullName}</div>;\n}\n\n// ✅ CORRECT\nfunction Component({ firstName, lastName }) {\n  const fullName = `${firstName} ${lastName}`; // Derive during render\n  return <div>{fullName}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\n### Measure Before Optimizing\n\nUse React DevTools Profiler to identify actual performance issues. Don't prematurely optimize.\n\n### Memoization Techniques\n\n```javascript\n// Memoize expensive computations\nfunction ProductList({ products, category }) {\n  const filteredProducts = useMemo(() => {\n    return products.filter(p => p.category === category);\n  }, [products, category]);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {filteredProducts.map(product => (\n        <Product key={product.id} product={product} />\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n// Memoize callbacks passed to children\nfunction Parent() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {\n    setCount(c => c + 1);\n  }, []);\n\n  return <MemoizedChild onClick={handleClick} />;\n}\n\n// Memoize components\nconst MemoizedChild = React.memo(function Child({ onClick }) {\n  return <button onClick={onClick}>Click me</button>;\n});\n```\n\n## Reference Documentation\n\nFor comprehensive details on React best practices, patterns, and anti-patterns, refer to:\n- `references/react_best_practices.md` -

Only call hooks at the top level of function components or custom hooks\n2. Never call hooks conditionally, in loops, or after early returns\n3. Hook calls must be in the same order on every render\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Hooks at top level\nfunction Component({ isSpecial }) {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  const [name, setName] = useState('');\n\n  if (!isSpecial) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  return <div>{name}: {count}</div>;\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Conditional hook\nfunction Component({ isLoggedIn }) {\n  if (isLoggedIn) {\n    const [user, setUser] = useState(null); // Violates Rules of Hooks!\n  }\n  return <div>...</div>;\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Hook after early return\nfunction Component({ data }) {\n  if (!data) return <Loading />;\n  const [processed, setProcessed] = useState(data); // Never called when data is null!\n  return <div>{processed}</div>;\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Hook in callback\nfunction Component() {\n  return (\n    <button onClick={() => {\n      const [clicked, setClicked] = useState(false); // Hooks can't be in event handlers!\n    }}>\n      Click\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### useState Hook\n- Use for local component state\n- State setter functions can accept updater functions for atomic updates\n- Multiple useState calls are better than complex state objects for unrelated data\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Separate state for independent values\nfunction Form() {\n  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');\n  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');\n  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');\n  // ...\n}\n\n// ✅ Good: Updater function for state based on previous state\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  const increment = () => {\n    setCount(c => c + 1); // Uses previous value\n  };\n\n  return <button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>;\n}\n```\n\n### useEffect Hook\n- Use for synchronization with external systems (APIs, subscriptions, DOM)\n- Always return cleanup functions when needed\n- Specify all dependencies in the dependency array\n- Separate unrelated effects into different useEffect calls\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Separate effects for separate concerns\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    logVisit(roomId);\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n  // ...\n}\n\n// ✅ Good: Cleanup function for subscriptions\nuseEffect(() => {\n  const subscription = subscribe(callback);\n  return () => subscription.unsubscribe();\n}, [callback]);\n\n// ❌ Avoid: Multiple concerns in one effect\nuseEffect(() => {\n  logVisit(roomId);\n  const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n  connection.connect();\n  return () => connection.disconnect();\n}, [roomId]); // Mixes analytics and connection logic\n```\n\n### useContext Hook\n- Use for accessing context values\n- Wrap context access in custom hooks for better ergonomics\n- Context providers should be at appropriate levels in the tree\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Custom hooks for context access\nexport function useTasks() {\n  return useContext(TasksContext);\n}\n\nexport function useTasksDispatch() {\n  return useContext(TasksDispatchContext);\n}\n\n// Usage in components\nfunction TaskList() {\n  const tasks = useTasks();\n  const dispatch = useTasksDispatch();\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n### useCallback Hook\n- Use to memoize callback functions\n- Essential when passing callbacks to optimized child components\n- Custom hooks should wrap returned functions in useCallback\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Memoize callbacks in custom hooks\nfunction useRouter() {\n  const { dispatch } = useContext(RouterStateContext);\n\n  const navigate = useCallback((url) => {\n    dispatch({ type: 'navigate', url });\n  }, [dispatch]);\n\n  const goBack = useCallback(() => {\n    dispatch({ type: 'back' });\n  }, [dispatch]);\n\n  return { navigate, goBack };\n}\n```\n\n### useMemo Hook\n- Use to memoize expensive computations\n- Helps optimize performance when combined with immutable arguments\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Memoize expensive computations\nfunction useIconStyle(icon) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n\n  return useMemo(() => {\n    const newIcon = { ...icon };\n    if (newIcon.enabled) {\n      newIcon.className = computeStyle(newIcon, theme);\n    }\n    return newIcon;\n  }, [icon, theme]);\n}\n```\n\n## Custom Hooks\n\n### Purpose and Naming\n- Extract reusable stateful logic into custom hooks\n- Always prefix custom hooks with \"use\"\n- Custom hooks enable logic sharing without component hierarchy changes\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Custom hook for form input logic\nfunction useFormInput(initialValue) {\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);\n\n  const handleChange = (e) => {\n    setValue(e.target.value);\n  };\n\n  return {\n    value,\n    onChange: handleChange\n  };\n}\n\n// Usage\nfunction Form() {\n  const firstNameProps = useFormInput('Mary');\n  const lastNameProps = useFormInput('Poppins');\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <input {...firstNameProps} />\n      <input {...lastNameProps} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Custom Hook Best Practices\n- Never pass hooks as props or create higher-order hooks\n- Don't mutate hook arguments\n- Avoid custom \"lifecycle\" hooks that just wrap useEffect\n- Return stable function references with useCallback\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ Bad: Don't pass hooks as props\nfunction ChatInput() {\n  return <Button useData={useDataWithLogging} />\n}\n\n// ✅ Good: Call hooks directly where needed\nfunction ChatInput() {\n  return <Button />\n}\n\nfunction Button() {\n  const data = useDataWithLogging();\n  // ...\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Custom lifecycle hooks\nfunction useMount(fn) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    fn();\n  }, []); // Missing dependency: fn\n}\n\n// ✅ Good: Use useEffect directly with proper dependencies\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  }, [roomId]);\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Don't mutate hook arguments\nfunction useIconStyle(icon) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  if (icon.enabled) {\n    icon.className = computeStyle(icon, theme); // Mutation!\n  }\n  return icon;\n}\n\n// ✅ Good: Create new objects instead\nfunction useIconStyle(icon) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  const newIcon = { ...icon };\n  if (newIcon.enabled) {\n    newIcon.className = computeStyle(newIcon, theme);\n  }\n  return newIcon;\n}\n```\n\n### Common Custom Hook Patterns\n\n#### Data Fetching Hook\n```javascript\nfunction useData(url) {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (!url) return;\n\n    let ignore = false;\n    fetch(url)\n      .then(response => response.json())\n      .then(json => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setData(json);\n        }\n      });\n\n    return () => {\n      ignore = true;\n    };\n  }, [url]);\n\n  return data;\n}\n\n// Usage\nfunction ShippingForm({ country }) {\n  const cities = useData(`/api/cities?country=${country}`);\n  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);\n  const areas = useData(city ? `/api/areas?city=${city}` : null);\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n#### External Store Subscription Hook\n```javascript\nfunction useOnlineStatus() {\n  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);\n  return isOnline;\n}\n\nfunction getSnapshot() {\n  return navigator.onLine;\n}\n\nfunction subscribe(callback) {\n  window.addEventListener('online', callback);\n  window.addEventListener('offline', callback);\n  return () => {\n    window.removeEventListener('online', callback);\n    window.removeEventListener('offline', callback);\n  };\n}\n```\n\n## Component Patterns\n\n### Composition Over Hierarchy\n- Pass JSX as children for flexibility\n- Use render props when children need access to internal state\n- Avoid deeply nested prop drilling\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Composition with children\nfunction Card({ children, title }) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"card\">\n      <h2>{title}</h2>\n      {children}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Card title=\"User Profile\">\n      <UserAvatar />\n      <UserDetails />\n    </Card>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Event Handlers\n- Define event handlers inside the component\n- Use arrow functions for handlers that need parameters\n- Avoid creating new function references unnecessarily in render\n\n```javascript\nfunction Button() {\n  const handleClick = () => {\n    console.log('clicked');\n  };\n\n  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;\n}\n\n// With parameters\nfunction ItemList({ items }) {\n  const handleItemClick = (id) => {\n    console.log('Item clicked:', id);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {items.map(item => (\n        <li key={item.id} onClick={() => handleItemClick(item.id)}>\n          {item.name}\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Purity and Immutability\n\n### Component Purity\n- Components should be pure functions of their props\n- Never mutate props or state directly\n- Avoid side effects in the render phase\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Pure component\nfunction UserGreeting({ user }) {\n  return <h1>Hello, {user.name}!</h1>;\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Mutating props\nfunction UserGreeting({ user }) {\n  user.lastSeen = new Date(); // Never mutate props!\n  return <h1>Hello, {user.name}!</h1>;\n}\n```\n\n### Immutability in State Updates\n- Always create new objects/arrays for state updates\n- Use spread operators for shallow copies\n- Use array methods that return new arrays (map, filter, etc.)\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Immutable state updates\nfunction TodoList() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    setTodos([...todos, { id: Date.now(), text }]);\n  };\n\n  const removeTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.filter(todo => todo.id !== id));\n  };\n\n  const toggleTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.map(todo =>\n      todo.id === id ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed } : todo\n    ));\n  };\n\n  // ...\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Mutating state\nfunction TodoList() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    todos.push({ id: Date.now(), text }); // Mutation!\n    setTodos(todos); // Won't trigger re-render correctly\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### JSX and Props Immutability\n- Never mutate values after passing to JSX\n- Create new objects for different props\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Create new objects for different props\nfunction Page({ colour }) {\n  const headerStyles = { colour, size: \"large\" };\n  const header = <Header styles={headerStyles} />;\n  const footerStyles = { colour, size: \"small\" };\n  const footer = <Footer styles={footerStyles} />;\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      {header}\n      <Content />\n      {footer}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Mutating after passing to JSX\nfunction Page({ colour }) {\n  const styles = { colour, size: \"large\" };\n  const header = <Header styles={styles} />;\n  styles.size = \"small\"; // Mutation after use in JSX!\n  const footer = <Footer styles={styles} />;\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      {header}\n      <Content />\n      {footer}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\n### When to Optimize\n- Measure before optimizing\n- Use React DevTools Profiler\n- Focus on slow renders and unnecessary re-renders\n\n### Optimization Techniques\n1. **React.memo** - Memoize components to prevent re-renders\n2. **useMemo** - Memoize expensive computations\n3. **useCallback** - Memoize callback functions\n4. **Code splitting** - Lazy load components\n5. **Virtualization** - Render only visible items in long lists\n\n```javascript\n// Memoized component\nconst MemoizedComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent({ data }) {\n  return <div>{data}</div>;\n});\n\n// With custom comparison\nconst MemoizedComponent = React.memo(\n  function MyComponent({ data }) {\n    return <div>{data}</div>;\n  },\n  (prevProps, nextProps) => {\n    return prevProps.data.id === nextProps.data.id;\n  }\n);\n```\n\n## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n1. **Don't use indexes as keys in lists** (unless list is static and items don't have unique IDs)\n2. **Don't call hooks conditionally**\n3. **Don't mutate state or props**\n4. **Don't create components inside components**\n5. **Don't pass hooks as props**\n6. **Avoid deeply nested prop drilling** (use context instead)\n7. **Don't use useEffect for derived state** (calculate during render instead)\n8. **Avoid unnecessary state** (derive from props when possible)\n\n## Modern React Features\n\n### Concurrent Features\n- React 18+ supports concurrent rendering\n- Use `useTransition` for non-urgent updates\n- Use `useDeferredValue` for deferring expensive renders\n\n### Server Components (Next.js, etc.)\n- Server Components fetch data on the server\n- Reduce client-side JavaScript bundle size\n- Better initial page load performance\n\n### Suspense\n- Handle loading states declaratively\n- Works with lazy loading and data fetching\n- Enables better user experiences during async operations\n\n```javascript\n// Lazy loading with Suspense\nconst LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n      <LazyComponent />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n```\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":1,"oldLines":16,"newStart":1,"newLines":20,"lines":[" # React Modern Best Practices Reference"," ","-This document provides comprehensive guidance on modern React best practices, patterns, and anti-patterns based on the latest React documentation.","+This document provides comprehensive guidance on modern React best practices, patterns, and anti-patterns based on the latest React documentation.

All examples use TypeScript and follow Next.js App Router conventions where applicable.\n\n## Component Structure\n\n### Functional Components\nAll components should be functional components using hooks with TypeScript. Class components are legacy (except for Error Boundaries which still require classes).\n\n```typescript\n// ✅ Good: Functional component with TypeScript\ninterface UserProfileProps {\n  userId: string;\n}\n\nexport function UserProfile({ userId }: UserProfileProps) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);\n  return <div>{user?.name}</div>;\n}\n\n// ❌ Avoid: Class components (legacy)\nclass UserProfile extends React.Component {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n### TypeScript Best Practices\n- Always define prop interfaces\n- Use explicit types for state\n- Avoid `any` types\n- Use generics for reusable components\n\n```typescript\n// ✅ Good: Explicit types\ninterface ButtonProps {\n  variant: 'primary' | 'secondary';\n  onClick: () => void;\n  children: ReactNode;\n  disabled?: boolean;\n}\n\nexport function Button({ variant, onClick, children, disabled = false }: ButtonProps) {\n  return (\n    <button onClick={onClick} disabled={disabled} className={variant}>\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n// ✅ Good: Generic components\ninterface ListProps<T> {\n  items: T[];\n  renderItem: (item: T) => ReactNode;\n  keyExtractor: (item: T) => string;\n}\n\nexport function List<T>({ items, renderItem, keyExtractor }: ListProps<T>) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {items.map(item => (\n        <li key={keyExtractor(item)}>{renderItem(item)}</li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Component Definition Rules\n- Define components at the module level, never inside other components\n- Avoid factory functions that create components\n- Components should be stable across renders\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Component defined at module level\nfunction Button({ color, children }) {\n  return <button style={{ backgroundColor: color }}>{children}</button>;\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  return <Button color=\"red\">Click me</Button>;\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Component defined inside another component\nfunction Parent() {\n  function Child() {  // Re-created on every render!\n    return <div>Child</div>;\n  }\n  return <Child />;\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Factory function creating components\nfunction createComponent(defaultValue) {\n  return function Component() {\n    // ...\n  };\n}\n```\n\n## Hooks Best Practices\n\n### Rules of Hooks\n1. Only call hooks at the top level of function components or custom hooks\n2. Never call hooks conditionally, in loops, or after early returns\n3. Hook calls must be in the same order on every render\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Hooks at top level\nfunction Component({ isSpecial }) {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  const [name, setName] = useState('');\n\n  if (!isSpecial) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  return <div>{name}: {count}</div>;\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Conditional hook\nfunction Component({ isLoggedIn }) {\n  if (isLoggedIn) {\n    const [user, setUser] = useState(null); // Violates Rules of Hooks!\n  }\n  return <div>...</div>;\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Hook after early return\nfunction Component({ data }) {\n  if (!data) return <Loading />;\n  const [processed, setProcessed] = useState(data); // Never called when data is null!\n  return <div>{processed}</div>;\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Hook in callback\nfunction Component() {\n  return (\n    <button onClick={() => {\n      const [clicked, setClicked] = useState(false); // Hooks can't be in event handlers!\n    }}>\n      Click\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### useState Hook\n- Use for local component state\n- State setter functions can accept updater functions for atomic updates\n- Multiple useState calls are better than complex state objects for unrelated data\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Separate state for independent values\nfunction Form() {\n  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');\n  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');\n  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');\n  // ...\n}\n\n// ✅ Good: Updater function for state based on previous state\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  const increment = () => {\n    setCount(c => c + 1); // Uses previous value\n  };\n\n  return <button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>;\n}\n```\n\n### useEffect Hook\n- Use for synchronization with external systems (APIs, subscriptions, DOM)\n- Always return cleanup functions when needed\n- Specify all dependencies in the dependency array\n- Separate unrelated effects into different useEffect calls\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Separate effects for separate concerns\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    logVisit(roomId);\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n  // ...\n}\n\n// ✅ Good: Cleanup function for subscriptions\nuseEffect(() => {\n  const subscription = subscribe(callback);\n  return () => subscription.unsubscribe();\n}, [callback]);\n\n// ❌ Avoid: Multiple concerns in one effect\nuseEffect(() => {\n  logVisit(roomId);\n  const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n  connection.connect();\n  return () => connection.disconnect();\n}, [roomId]); // Mixes analytics and connection logic\n```\n\n### useContext Hook\n- Use for accessing context values\n- Wrap context access in custom hooks for better ergonomics\n- Context providers should be at appropriate levels in the tree\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Custom hooks for context access\nexport function useTasks() {\n  return useContext(TasksContext);\n}\n\nexport function useTasksDispatch() {\n  return useContext(TasksDispatchContext);\n}\n\n// Usage in components\nfunction TaskList() {\n  const tasks = useTasks();\n  const dispatch = useTasksDispatch();\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n### useCallback Hook\n- Use to memoize callback functions\n- Essential when passing callbacks to optimized child components\n- Custom hooks should wrap returned functions in useCallback\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Memoize callbacks in custom hooks\nfunction useRouter() {\n  const { dispatch } = useContext(RouterStateContext);\n\n  const navigate = useCallback((url) => {\n    dispatch({ type: 'navigate', url });\n  }, [dispatch]);\n\n  const goBack = useCallback(() => {\n    dispatch({ type: 'back' });\n  }, [dispatch]);\n\n  return { navigate, goBack };\n}\n```\n\n### useMemo Hook\n- Use to memoize expensive computations\n- Helps optimize performance when combined with immutable arguments\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Memoize expensive computations\nfunction useIconStyle(icon) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n\n  return useMemo(() => {\n    const newIcon = { ...icon };\n    if (newIcon.enabled) {\n      newIcon.className = computeStyle(newIcon, theme);\n    }\n    return newIcon;\n  }, [icon, theme]);\n}\n```\n\n## Custom Hooks\n\n### Purpose and Naming\n- Extract reusable stateful logic into custom hooks\n- Always prefix custom hooks with \"use\"\n- Custom hooks enable logic sharing without component hierarchy changes\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Custom hook for form input logic\nfunction useFormInput(initialValue) {\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);\n\n  const handleChange = (e) => {\n    setValue(e.target.value);\n  };\n\n  return {\n    value,\n    onChange: handleChange\n  };\n}\n\n// Usage\nfunction Form() {\n  const firstNameProps = useFormInput('Mary');\n  const lastNameProps = useFormInput('Poppins');\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <input {...firstNameProps} />\n      <input {...lastNameProps} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Custom Hook Best Practices\n- Never pass hooks as props or create higher-order hooks\n- Don't mutate hook arguments\n- Avoid custom \"lifecycle\" hooks that just wrap useEffect\n- Return stable function references with useCallback\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ Bad: Don't pass hooks as props\nfunction ChatInput() {\n  return <Button useData={useDataWithLogging} />\n}\n\n// ✅ Good: Call hooks directly where needed\nfunction ChatInput() {\n  return <Button />\n}\n\nfunction Button() {\n  const data = useDataWithLogging();\n  // ...\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Custom lifecycle hooks\nfunction useMount(fn) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    fn();\n  }, []); // Missing dependency: fn\n}\n\n// ✅ Good: Use useEffect directly with proper dependencies\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  }, [roomId]);\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Don't mutate hook arguments\nfunction useIconStyle(icon) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  if (icon.enabled) {\n    icon.className = computeStyle(icon, theme); // Mutation!\n  }\n  return icon;\n}\n\n// ✅ Good: Create new objects instead\nfunction useIconStyle(icon) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  const newIcon = { ...icon };\n  if (newIcon.enabled) {\n    newIcon.className = computeStyle(newIcon, theme);\n  }\n  return newIcon;\n}\n```\n\n### Common Custom Hook Patterns\n\n#### Data Fetching Hook\n```javascript\nfunction useData(url) {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (!url) return;\n\n    let ignore = false;\n    fetch(url)\n      .then(response => response.json())\n      .then(json => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setData(json);\n        }\n      });\n\n    return () => {\n      ignore = true;\n    };\n  }, [url]);\n\n  return data;\n}\n\n// Usage\nfunction ShippingForm({ country }) {\n  const cities = useData(`/api/cities?country=${country}`);\n  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);\n  const areas = useData(city ? `/api/areas?city=${city}` : null);\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n#### External Store Subscription Hook\n```javascript\nfunction useOnlineStatus() {\n  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);\n  return isOnline;\n}\n\nfunction getSnapshot() {\n  return navigator.onLine;\n}\n\nfunction subscribe(callback) {\n  window.addEventListener('online', callback);\n  window.addEventListener('offline', callback);\n  return () => {\n    window.removeEventListener('online', callback);\n    window.removeEventListener('offline', callback);\n  };\n}\n```\n\n## Component Patterns\n\n### Composition Over Hierarchy\n- Pass JSX as children for flexibility\n- Use render props when children need access to internal state\n- Avoid deeply nested prop drilling\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Composition with children\nfunction Card({ children, title }) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"card\">\n      <h2>{title}</h2>\n      {children}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Card title=\"User Profile\">\n      <UserAvatar />\n      <UserDetails />\n    </Card>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Event Handlers\n- Define event handlers inside the component\n- Use arrow functions for handlers that need parameters\n- Avoid creating new function references unnecessarily in render\n\n```javascript\nfunction Button() {\n  const handleClick = () => {\n    console.log('clicked');\n  };\n\n  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;\n}\n\n// With parameters\nfunction ItemList({ items }) {\n  const handleItemClick = (id) => {\n    console.log('Item clicked:', id);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {items.map(item => (\n        <li key={item.id} onClick={() => handleItemClick(item.id)}>\n          {item.name}\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Purity and Immutability\n\n### Component Purity\n- Components should be pure functions of their props\n- Never mutate props or state directly\n- Avoid side effects in the render phase\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Pure component\nfunction UserGreeting({ user }) {\n  return <h1>Hello, {user.name}!</h1>;\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Mutating props\nfunction UserGreeting({ user }) {\n  user.lastSeen = new Date(); // Never mutate props!\n  return <h1>Hello, {user.name}!</h1>;\n}\n```\n\n### Immutability in State Updates\n- Always create new objects/arrays for state updates\n- Use spread operators for shallow copies\n- Use array methods that return new arrays (map, filter, etc.)\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Immutable state updates\nfunction TodoList() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    setTodos([...todos, { id: Date.now(), text }]);\n  };\n\n  const removeTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.filter(todo => todo.id !== id));\n  };\n\n  const toggleTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.map(todo =>\n      todo.id === id ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed } : todo\n    ));\n  };\n\n  // ...\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Mutating state\nfunction TodoList() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    todos.push({ id: Date.now(), text }); // Mutation!\n    setTodos(todos); // Won't trigger re-render correctly\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### JSX and Props Immutability\n- Never mutate values after passing to JSX\n- Create new objects for different props\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Create new objects for different props\nfunction Page({ colour }) {\n  const headerStyles = { colour, size: \"large\" };\n  const header = <Header styles={headerStyles} />;\n  const footerStyles = { colour, size: \"small\" };\n  const footer = <Footer styles={footerStyles} />;\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      {header}\n      <Content />\n      {footer}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Mutating after passing to JSX\nfunction Page({ colour }) {\n  const styles = { colour, size: \"large\" };\n  const header = <Header styles={styles} />;\n  styles.size = \"small\"; // Mutation after use in JSX!\n  const footer = <Footer styles={styles} />;\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      {header}\n      <Content />\n      {footer}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\n### When to Optimize\n- Measure before optimizing\n- Use React DevTools Profiler\n- Focus on slow renders and unnecessary re-renders\n\n### Optimization Techniques\n1. **React.memo** - Memoize components to prevent re-renders\n2. **useMemo** - Memoize expensive computations\n3. **useCallback** - Memoize callback functions\n4. **Code splitting** - Lazy load components\n5. **Virtualization** - Render only visible items in long lists\n\n```javascript\n// Memoized component\nconst MemoizedComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent({ data }) {\n  return <div>{data}</div>;\n});\n\n// With custom comparison\nconst MemoizedComponent = React.memo(\n  function MyComponent({ data }) {\n    return <div>{data}</div>;\n  },\n  (prevProps, nextProps) => {\n    return prevProps.data.id === nextProps.data.id;\n  }\n);\n```\n\n## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n1. **Don't use indexes as keys in lists** (unless list is static and items don't have unique IDs)\n2. **Don't call hooks conditionally**\n3. **Don't mutate state or props**\n4. **Don't create components inside components**\n5. **Don't pass hooks as props**\n6. **Avoid deeply nested prop drilling** (use context instead)\n7. **Don't use useEffect for derived state** (calculate during render instead)\n8. **Avoid unnecessary state** (derive from props when possible)\n\n## Modern React Features\n\n### Concurrent Features\n- React 18+ supports concurrent rendering\n- Use `useTransition` for non-urgent updates\n- Use `useDeferredValue` for deferring expensive renders\n\n### Server Components (Next.js, etc.)\n- Server Components fetch data on the server\n- Reduce client-side JavaScript bundle size\n- Better initial page load performance\n\n### Suspense\n- Handle loading states declaratively\n- Works with lazy loading and data fetching\n- Enables better user experiences during async operations\n\n```javascript\n// Lazy loading with Suspense\nconst LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n      <LazyComponent />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n```\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":70,"oldLines":13,"newStart":70,"newLines":18,"lines":[" - Avoid factory functions that create components"," - Components should be stable across renders"," ","-```javascript","+```typescript"," // ✅ Good: Component defined at module level","-function Button({ color, children }) {","+interface ButtonProps {","+  color: string;","+  children: ReactNode;","+}","+","+export function Button({ color, children }: ButtonProps) {","   return <button style={{ backgroundColor: color }}>{children}</button>;"," }"," ","-function App() {","+export function App() {","   return <Button color=\"red\">Click me</Button>;"," }"," "]},{"oldStart":89,"oldLines":13,"newStart":94,"newLines":188,"lines":[" }"," "," // ❌ Bad: Factory function creating components","-function createComponent(defaultValue) {","+function createComponent(defaultValue: string) {","   return function Component() {","     // ...","   };"," }"," ```"," ","+## Next.js Server Components (App Router)","+","+### Server vs Client Components","+","+**Server Components (Default):**","+- Can be async functions","+- Fetch data directly with await","+- No hooks, event handlers, or browser APIs","+- Smaller bundle size","+- Better SEO and initial load","+","+**Client Components:**","+- Require 'use client' directive","+- Can use hooks and browser APIs","+- Handle interactivity and state","+","+```typescript","+// ✅ Server Component (default)","+interface Post {","+  id: string;","+  title: string;","+  content: string;","+}","+","+interface BlogPostProps {","+  postId: string;","+}","+","+export async function BlogPost({ postId }: BlogPostProps) {","+  // Direct data fetching in Server Component","+  const post: Post = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/posts/${postId}`, {","+    next: { revalidate: 3600 } // ISR: revalidate every hour","+  }).then(res => res.json());","+","+  return (","+    <article>","+      <h1>{post.title}</h1>","+      <p>{post.content}</p>","+    </article>","+  );","+}","+","+// ✅ Client Component (when needed)","+'use client';","+","+interface LikeButtonProps {","+  postId: string;","+  initialLikes: number;","+}","+","+export function LikeButton({ postId, initialLikes }: LikeButtonProps) {","+  const [likes, setLikes] = useState(initialLikes);","+  const [isLiked, setIsLiked] = useState(false);","+","+  const handleLike = async () => {","+    setIsLiked(!isLiked);","+    setLikes(isLiked ? likes - 1 : likes + 1);","+    await fetch(`/api/posts/${postId}/like`, { method: 'POST' });","+  };","+","+  return (","+    <button onClick={handleLike}>","+      {isLiked ?

All examples use TypeScript and follow Next.js App Router conventions where applicable.\n\n## Component Structure\n\n### Functional Components\nAll components should be functional components using hooks with TypeScript. Class components are legacy (except for Error Boundaries which still require classes).\n\n```typescript\n// ✅ Good: Functional component with TypeScript\ninterface UserProfileProps {\n  userId: string;\n}\n\nexport function UserProfile({ userId }: UserProfileProps) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);\n  return <div>{user?.name}</div>;\n}\n\n// ❌ Avoid: Class components (legacy)\nclass UserProfile extends React.Component {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n### TypeScript Best Practices\n- Always define prop interfaces\n- Use explicit types for state\n- Avoid `any` types\n- Use generics for reusable components\n\n```typescript\n// ✅ Good: Explicit types\ninterface ButtonProps {\n  variant: 'primary' | 'secondary';\n  onClick: () => void;\n  children: ReactNode;\n  disabled?: boolean;\n}\n\nexport function Button({ variant, onClick, children, disabled = false }: ButtonProps) {\n  return (\n    <button onClick={onClick} disabled={disabled} className={variant}>\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n// ✅ Good: Generic components\ninterface ListProps<T> {\n  items: T[];\n  renderItem: (item: T) => ReactNode;\n  keyExtractor: (item: T) => string;\n}\n\nexport function List<T>({ items, renderItem, keyExtractor }: ListProps<T>) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {items.map(item => (\n        <li key={keyExtractor(item)}>{renderItem(item)}</li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Component Definition Rules\n- Define components at the module level, never inside other components\n- Avoid factory functions that create components\n- Components should be stable across renders\n\n```typescript\n// ✅ Good: Component defined at module level\ninterface ButtonProps {\n  color: string;\n  children: ReactNode;\n}\n\nexport function Button({ color, children }: ButtonProps) {\n  return <button style={{ backgroundColor: color }}>{children}</button>;\n}\n\nexport function App() {\n  return <Button color=\"red\">Click me</Button>;\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Component defined inside another component\nfunction Parent() {\n  function Child() {  // Re-created on every render!\n    return <div>Child</div>;\n  }\n  return <Child />;\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Factory function creating components\nfunction createComponent(defaultValue: string) {\n  return function Component() {\n    // ...\n  };\n}\n```\n\n## Next.js Server Components (App Router)\n\n### Server vs Client Components\n\n**Server Components (Default):**\n- Can be async functions\n- Fetch data directly with await\n- No hooks, event handlers, or browser APIs\n- Smaller bundle size\n- Better SEO and initial load\n\n**Client Components:**\n- Require 'use client' directive\n- Can use hooks and browser APIs\n- Handle interactivity and state\n\n```typescript\n// ✅ Server Component (default)\ninterface Post {\n  id: string;\n  title: string;\n  content: string;\n}\n\ninterface BlogPostProps {\n  postId: string;\n}\n\nexport async function BlogPost({ postId }: BlogPostProps) {\n  // Direct data fetching in Server Component\n  const post: Post = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/posts/${postId}`, {\n    next: { revalidate: 3600 } // ISR: revalidate every hour\n  }).then(res => res.json());\n\n  return (\n    <article>\n      <h1>{post.title}</h1>\n      <p>{post.content}</p>\n    </article>\n  );\n}\n\n// ✅ Client Component (when needed)\n'use client';\n\ninterface LikeButtonProps {\n  postId: string;\n  initialLikes: number;\n}\n\nexport function LikeButton({ postId, initialLikes }: LikeButtonProps) {\n  const [likes, setLikes] = useState(initialLikes);\n  const [isLiked, setIsLiked] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleLike = async () => {\n    setIsLiked(!isLiked);\n    setLikes(isLiked ? likes - 1 : likes + 1);\n    await fetch(`/api/posts/${postId}/like`, { method: 'POST' });\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <button onClick={handleLike}>\n      {isLiked ? '❤️' : '🤍'} {likes}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Composing Server and Client Components\n\n```typescript\n// app/posts/[id]/page.tsx (Server Component)\nimport { LikeButton } from '@/components/LikeButton';\nimport { Comments } from '@/components/Comments';\n\nexport default async function PostPage({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {\n  const [post, comments] = await Promise.all([\n    fetch(`https://api.example.com/posts/${params.id}`).then(res => res.json()),\n    fetch(`https://api.example.com/posts/${params.id}/comments`).then(res => res.json())\n  ]);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{post.title}</h1>\n      <p>{post.content}</p>\n\n      {/* Client Component for interactivity */}\n      <LikeButton postId={post.id} initialLikes={post.likes} />\n\n      {/* Can pass server-fetched data to client components */}\n      <Comments comments={comments} postId={post.id} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## React 19 Features\n\n### The `use` Hook\n\nThe `use` hook unwraps promises and context values. Unlike other hooks, it can be called conditionally.\n\n```typescript\n'use client';\n\nimport { use, Suspense } from 'react';\n\ninterface User {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  email: string;\n}\n\n// ✅ Using the use hook with promises\nfunction UserProfile({ userPromise }: { userPromise: Promise<User> }) {\n  const user = use(userPromise); // Unwraps the promise\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>{user.name}</h2>\n      <p>{user.email}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n// Wrap with Suspense\nexport function UserProfilePage({ userId }: { userId: string }) {\n  const userPromise = fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`).then(res => res.json());\n\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading user...</div>}>\n      <UserProfile userPromise={userPromise} />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n\n// ✅ Conditional use of the use hook (unique to this hook!)\nfunction Message({ messagePromise, showMessage }: {\n  messagePromise: Promise<string>;\n  showMessage: boolean;\n}) {\n  if (!showMessage) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  const message = use(messagePromise); // Can be conditional!\n  return <p>{message}</p>;\n}\n```\n\n### Error Handling with use Hook\n\n```typescript\n'use client';\n\nimport { use, Suspense } from 'react';\n\nfunction DataDisplay({ dataPromise }: { dataPromise: Promise<Data> }) {\n  const data = use(dataPromise); // Errors bubble to nearest ErrorBoundary\n  return <div>{data.value}</div>;\n}\n\nexport function DataPage() {\n  const dataPromise = fetchData();\n\n  return (\n    <ErrorBoundary fallback={<ErrorUI />}>\n      <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n        <DataDisplay dataPromise={dataPromise} />\n      </Suspense>\n    </ErrorBoundary>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Hooks Best Practices\n\n### Rules of Hooks\n1. Only call hooks at the top level of function components or custom hooks\n2. Never call hooks conditionally, in loops, or after early returns\n3. Hook calls must be in the same order on every render\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Hooks at top level\nfunction Component({ isSpecial }) {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  const [name, setName] = useState('');\n\n  if (!isSpecial) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  return <div>{name}: {count}</div>;\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Conditional hook\nfunction Component({ isLoggedIn }) {\n  if (isLoggedIn) {\n    const [user, setUser] = useState(null); // Violates Rules of Hooks!\n  }\n  return <div>...</div>;\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Hook after early return\nfunction Component({ data }) {\n  if (!data) return <Loading />;\n  const [processed, setProcessed] = useState(data); // Never called when data is null!\n  return <div>{processed}</div>;\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Hook in callback\nfunction Component() {\n  return (\n    <button onClick={() => {\n      const [clicked, setClicked] = useState(false); // Hooks can't be in event handlers!\n    }}>\n      Click\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### useState Hook\n- Use for local component state\n- State setter functions can accept updater functions for atomic updates\n- Multiple useState calls are better than complex state objects for unrelated data\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Separate state for independent values\nfunction Form() {\n  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');\n  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');\n  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');\n  // ...\n}\n\n// ✅ Good: Updater function for state based on previous state\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  const increment = () => {\n    setCount(c => c + 1); // Uses previous value\n  };\n\n  return <button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>;\n}\n```\n\n### useEffect Hook\n- Use for synchronization with external systems (APIs, subscriptions, DOM)\n- Always return cleanup functions when needed\n- Specify all dependencies in the dependency array\n- Separate unrelated effects into different useEffect calls\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Separate effects for separate concerns\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    logVisit(roomId);\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n  // ...\n}\n\n// ✅ Good: Cleanup function for subscriptions\nuseEffect(() => {\n  const subscription = subscribe(callback);\n  return () => subscription.unsubscribe();\n}, [callback]);\n\n// ❌ Avoid: Multiple concerns in one effect\nuseEffect(() => {\n  logVisit(roomId);\n  const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n  connection.connect();\n  return () => connection.disconnect();\n}, [roomId]); // Mixes analytics and connection logic\n```\n\n### useContext Hook\n- Use for accessing context values\n- Wrap context access in custom hooks for better ergonomics\n- Context providers should be at appropriate levels in the tree\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Custom hooks for context access\nexport function useTasks() {\n  return useContext(TasksContext);\n}\n\nexport function useTasksDispatch() {\n  return useContext(TasksDispatchContext);\n}\n\n// Usage in components\nfunction TaskList() {\n  const tasks = useTasks();\n  const dispatch = useTasksDispatch();\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n### useCallback Hook\n- Use to memoize callback functions\n- Essential when passing callbacks to optimized child components\n- Custom hooks should wrap returned functions in useCallback\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Memoize callbacks in custom hooks\nfunction useRouter() {\n  const { dispatch } = useContext(RouterStateContext);\n\n  const navigate = useCallback((url) => {\n    dispatch({ type: 'navigate', url });\n  }, [dispatch]);\n\n  const goBack = useCallback(() => {\n    dispatch({ type: 'back' });\n  }, [dispatch]);\n\n  return { navigate, goBack };\n}\n```\n\n### useMemo Hook\n- Use to memoize expensive computations\n- Helps optimize performance when combined with immutable arguments\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Memoize expensive computations\nfunction useIconStyle(icon) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n\n  return useMemo(() => {\n    const newIcon = { ...icon };\n    if (newIcon.enabled) {\n      newIcon.className = computeStyle(newIcon, theme);\n    }\n    return newIcon;\n  }, [icon, theme]);\n}\n```\n\n## Custom Hooks\n\n### Purpose and Naming\n- Extract reusable stateful logic into custom hooks\n- Always prefix custom hooks with \"use\"\n- Custom hooks enable logic sharing without component hierarchy changes\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Custom hook for form input logic\nfunction useFormInput(initialValue) {\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);\n\n  const handleChange = (e) => {\n    setValue(e.target.value);\n  };\n\n  return {\n    value,\n    onChange: handleChange\n  };\n}\n\n// Usage\nfunction Form() {\n  const firstNameProps = useFormInput('Mary');\n  const lastNameProps = useFormInput('Poppins');\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <input {...firstNameProps} />\n      <input {...lastNameProps} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Custom Hook Best Practices\n- Never pass hooks as props or create higher-order hooks\n- Don't mutate hook arguments\n- Avoid custom \"lifecycle\" hooks that just wrap useEffect\n- Return stable function references with useCallback\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ Bad: Don't pass hooks as props\nfunction ChatInput() {\n  return <Button useData={useDataWithLogging} />\n}\n\n// ✅ Good: Call hooks directly where needed\nfunction ChatInput() {\n  return <Button />\n}\n\nfunction Button() {\n  const data = useDataWithLogging();\n  // ...\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Custom lifecycle hooks\nfunction useMount(fn) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    fn();\n  }, []); // Missing dependency: fn\n}\n\n// ✅ Good: Use useEffect directly with proper dependencies\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  }, [roomId]);\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Don't mutate hook arguments\nfunction useIconStyle(icon) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  if (icon.enabled) {\n    icon.className = computeStyle(icon, theme); // Mutation!\n  }\n  return icon;\n}\n\n// ✅ Good: Create new objects instead\nfunction useIconStyle(icon) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  const newIcon = { ...icon };\n  if (newIcon.enabled) {\n    newIcon.className = computeStyle(newIcon, theme);\n  }\n  return newIcon;\n}\n```\n\n### Common Custom Hook Patterns\n\n#### Data Fetching Hook\n```javascript\nfunction useData(url) {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (!url) return;\n\n    let ignore = false;\n    fetch(url)\n      .then(response => response.json())\n      .then(json => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setData(json);\n        }\n      });\n\n    return () => {\n      ignore = true;\n    };\n  }, [url]);\n\n  return data;\n}\n\n// Usage\nfunction ShippingForm({ country }) {\n  const cities = useData(`/api/cities?country=${country}`);\n  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);\n  const areas = useData(city ? `/api/areas?city=${city}` : null);\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n#### External Store Subscription Hook\n```javascript\nfunction useOnlineStatus() {\n  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);\n  return isOnline;\n}\n\nfunction getSnapshot() {\n  return navigator.onLine;\n}\n\nfunction subscribe(callback) {\n  window.addEventListener('online', callback);\n  window.addEventListener('offline', callback);\n  return () => {\n    window.removeEventListener('online', callback);\n    window.removeEventListener('offline', callback);\n  };\n}\n```\n\n## Component Patterns\n\n### Composition Over Hierarchy\n- Pass JSX as children for flexibility\n- Use render props when children need access to internal state\n- Avoid deeply nested prop drilling\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Composition with children\nfunction Card({ children, title }) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"card\">\n      <h2>{title}</h2>\n      {children}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Card title=\"User Profile\">\n      <UserAvatar />\n      <UserDetails />\n    </Card>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Event Handlers\n- Define event handlers inside the component\n- Use arrow functions for handlers that need parameters\n- Avoid creating new function references unnecessarily in render\n\n```javascript\nfunction Button() {\n  const handleClick = () => {\n    console.log('clicked');\n  };\n\n  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;\n}\n\n// With parameters\nfunction ItemList({ items }) {\n  const handleItemClick = (id) => {\n    console.log('Item clicked:', id);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {items.map(item => (\n        <li key={item.id} onClick={() => handleItemClick(item.id)}>\n          {item.name}\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Purity and Immutability\n\n### Component Purity\n- Components should be pure functions of their props\n- Never mutate props or state directly\n- Avoid side effects in the render phase\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Pure component\nfunction UserGreeting({ user }) {\n  return <h1>Hello, {user.name}!</h1>;\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Mutating props\nfunction UserGreeting({ user }) {\n  user.lastSeen = new Date(); // Never mutate props!\n  return <h1>Hello, {user.name}!</h1>;\n}\n```\n\n### Immutability in State Updates\n- Always create new objects/arrays for state updates\n- Use spread operators for shallow copies\n- Use array methods that return new arrays (map, filter, etc.)\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Immutable state updates\nfunction TodoList() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    setTodos([...todos, { id: Date.now(), text }]);\n  };\n\n  const removeTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.filter(todo => todo.id !== id));\n  };\n\n  const toggleTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.map(todo =>\n      todo.id === id ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed } : todo\n    ));\n  };\n\n  // ...\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Mutating state\nfunction TodoList() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    todos.push({ id: Date.now(), text }); // Mutation!\n    setTodos(todos); // Won't trigger re-render correctly\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### JSX and Props Immutability\n- Never mutate values after passing to JSX\n- Create new objects for different props\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Create new objects for different props\nfunction Page({ colour }) {\n  const headerStyles = { colour, size: \"large\" };\n  const header = <Header styles={headerStyles} />;\n  const footerStyles = { colour, size: \"small\" };\n  const footer = <Footer styles={footerStyles} />;\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      {header}\n      <Content />\n      {footer}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Mutating after passing to JSX\nfunction Page({ colour }) {\n  const styles = { colour, size: \"large\" };\n  const header = <Header styles={styles} />;\n  styles.size = \"small\"; // Mutation after use in JSX!\n  const footer = <Footer styles={styles} />;\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      {header}\n      <Content />\n      {footer}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\n### When to Optimize\n- Measure before optimizing\n- Use React DevTools Profiler\n- Focus on slow renders and unnecessary re-renders\n\n### Optimization Techniques\n1. **React.memo** - Memoize components to prevent re-renders\n2. **useMemo** - Memoize expensive computations\n3. **useCallback** - Memoize callback functions\n4. **Code splitting** - Lazy load components\n5. **Virtualization** - Render only visible items in long lists\n\n```javascript\n// Memoized component\nconst MemoizedComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent({ data }) {\n  return <div>{data}</div>;\n});\n\n// With custom comparison\nconst MemoizedComponent = React.memo(\n  function MyComponent({ data }) {\n    return <div>{data}</div>;\n  },\n  (prevProps, nextProps) => {\n    return prevProps.data.id === nextProps.data.id;\n  }\n);\n```\n\n## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n1. **Don't use indexes as keys in lists** (unless list is static and items don't have unique IDs)\n2. **Don't call hooks conditionally**\n3. **Don't mutate state or props**\n4. **Don't create components inside components**\n5. **Don't pass hooks as props**\n6. **Avoid deeply nested prop drilling** (use context instead)\n7. **Don't use useEffect for derived state** (calculate during render instead)\n8. **Avoid unnecessary state** (derive from props when possible)\n\n## Modern React Features\n\n### Concurrent Features\n- React 18+ supports concurrent rendering\n- Use `useTransition` for non-urgent updates\n- Use `useDeferredValue` for deferring expensive renders\n\n### Server Components (Next.js, etc.)\n- Server Components fetch data on the server\n- Reduce client-side JavaScript bundle size\n- Better initial page load performance\n\n### Suspense\n- Handle loading states declaratively\n- Works with lazy loading and data fetching\n- Enables better user experiences during async operations\n\n```javascript\n// Lazy loading with Suspense\nconst LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n      <LazyComponent />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n```\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":283,"oldLines":9,"newStart":283,"newLines":13,"lines":[" 2.

They must be class components (for now).\n\n```typescript\n'use client';\n\nimport { Component, ReactNode, ErrorInfo } from 'react';\n\ninterface Props {\n  children: ReactNode;\n  fallback?: ReactNode;\n  onError?: (error: Error, errorInfo: ErrorInfo) => void;\n}\n\ninterface State {\n  hasError: boolean;\n  error?: Error;\n}\n\nexport class ErrorBoundary extends Component<Props, State> {\n  constructor(props: Props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = { hasError: false };\n  }\n\n  static getDerivedStateFromError(error: Error): State {\n    return { hasError: true, error };\n  }\n\n  componentDidCatch(error: Error, errorInfo: ErrorInfo) {\n    console.error('Error caught by boundary:', error, errorInfo);\n    this.props.onError?.(error, errorInfo);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n

<button onClick={() => this.setState({ hasError: false })}>\n            Try again\n          </button>\n        </div>\n      );\n    }\n\n    return this.props.children;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Error Handling in Server Components\n\n```typescript\n// app/posts/[id]/page.tsx\nexport default async function PostPage({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {\n  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/posts/${params.id}`);\n\n  if (!res.ok) {\n    // This will be caught by the nearest error.tsx file\n    throw new Error('Failed to load post');\n  }\n\n  const post = await res.json();\n  return <article>{post.content}</article>;\n}\n\n// app/posts/[id]/error.tsx\n'use client';\n\nexport default function Error({\n  error,\n  reset,\n}: {\n  error: Error & { digest?: string };\n  reset: () => void;\n}) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>Something went wrong!</h2>\n      <p>{error.message}</p>\n      <button onClick={reset}>Try again</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Error Handling with use Hook\n\n```typescript\n'use client';\n\nfunction DataComponent({ dataPromise }: { dataPromise: Promise<Data> }) {\n  // If promise rejects, error bubbles to ErrorBoundary\n  const data = use(dataPromise);\n  return <div>{data.value}</div>;\n}\n\nexport function Page() {\n  const dataPromise = fetchData();\n\n  return (\n    <ErrorBoundary>\n      <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n        <DataComponent dataPromise={dataPromise} />\n      </Suspense>\n    </ErrorBoundary>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Testing\n\n### Vitest + Testing Library\n\nTesting modern React components with TypeScript.\n\n#### Basic Component Tests\n\n```typescript\n// Button.test.tsx\nimport { describe, it, expect, vi } from 'vitest';\nimport { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport { Button } from './Button';\n\ndescribe('Button', () => {\n  it('renders with correct text', () => {\n    render(<Button>Click me</Button>);\n    expect(screen.getByRole('button')).toHaveTextContent('Click me');\n  });\n\n  it('calls onClick when clicked', () => {\n    const handleClick = vi.fn();\n    render(<Button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</Button>);\n\n    fireEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button'));\n    expect(handleClick).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);\n  });\n\n  it('is disabled when disabled prop is true', () => {\n    render(<Button disabled>Click me</Button>);\n    expect(screen.getByRole('button')).toBeDisabled();\n  });\n\n  it('applies correct variant class', () => {\n    render(<Button variant=\"primary\">Primary</Button>);\n    expect(screen.getByRole('button')).toHaveClass('primary');\n  });\n});\n```\n\n#### Testing Custom Hooks\n\n```typescript\n// useCounter.test.ts\nimport { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';\nimport { renderHook, act } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport { useCounter } from './useCounter';\n\ndescribe('useCounter', () => {\n  it('initializes with default value', () => {\n    const { result } = renderHook(() => useCounter(0));\n    expect(result.current.count).toBe(0);\n  });\n\n  it('increments counter', () => {\n    const { result } = renderHook(() => useCounter(0));\n\n    act(() => {\n      result.current.increment();\n    });\n\n    expect(result.current.count).toBe(1);\n  });\n\n  it('decrements counter', () => {\n    const { result } = renderHook(() => useCounter(5));\n\n    act(() => {\n      result.current.decrement();\n    });\n\n    expect(result.current.count).toBe(4);\n  });\n\n  it('resets to initial value', () => {\n    const { result } = renderHook(() => useCounter(10));\n\n    act(() => {\n      result.current.increment();\n      result.current.increment();\n      result.current.reset();\n    });\n\n    expect(result.current.count).toBe(10);\n  });\n});\n```\n\n#### Testing Components with Context\n\n```typescript\n// UserMenu.test.tsx\nimport { describe, it, expect, vi } from 'vitest';\nimport { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport { UserProvider } from './UserContext';\nimport { UserMenu } from './UserMenu';\n\nconst mockUser = {\n  id: '1',\n  name: 'John Doe',\n  email: 'john@example.com'\n};\n\ndescribe('UserMenu', () => {\n  it('displays user name when logged in', () => {\n    render(\n      <UserProvider initialUser={mockUser}>\n        <UserMenu />\n      </UserProvider>\n    );\n\n    expect(screen.getByText('John Doe')).toBeInTheDocument();\n  });\n\n  it('calls logout when logout button clicked', () => {\n    const mockLogout = vi.fn();\n\n    render(\n      <UserProvider initialUser={mockUser} onLogout={mockLogout}>\n        <UserMenu />\n      </UserProvider>\n    );\n\n    fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Logout'));\n    expect(mockLogout).toHaveBeenCalled();\n  });\n\n  it('shows login button when not logged in', () => {\n    render(\n      <UserProvider initialUser={null}>\n        <UserMenu />\n      </UserProvider>\n    );\n\n    expect(screen.getByText('Login')).toBeInTheDocument();\n  });\n});\n```\n\n#### Testing Async Components (Server Components)\n\n```typescript\n// UserProfile.test.tsx\nimport { describe, it, expect, vi, beforeEach } from 'vitest';\nimport { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport { UserProfile } from './UserProfile';\n\n// Mock fetch\nglobal.fetch = vi.fn();\n\ndescribe('UserProfile', () => {\n  beforeEach(() => {\n    vi.clearAllMocks();\n  });\n\n  it('renders user data', async () => {\n    const mockUser = {\n      id: '1',\n      name: 'Jane Doe',\n      email: 'jane@example.com'\n    };\n\n    (global.fetch as any).mockResolvedValueOnce({\n      ok: true,\n      json: async () => mockUser,\n    });\n\n    render(await UserProfile({ userId: '1' }));\n\n    expect(screen.getByText('Jane Doe')).toBeInTheDocument();\n    expect(screen.getByText('jane@example.com')).toBeInTheDocument();\n  });\n\n  it('handles fetch errors', async () => {\n    (global.fetch as any).mockResolvedValueOnce({\n      ok: false,\n    });\n\n    await expect(async () => {\n      render(await UserProfile({ userId: '1' }));\n    }).rejects.toThrow('Failed to fetch user');\n  });\n\n  it('calls fetch with correct URL', async () => {\n    (global.fetch as any).mockResolvedValueOnce({\n      ok: true,\n      json: async () => ({}),\n    });\n\n    await UserProfile({ userId: '123' });\n\n    expect(global.fetch).toHaveBeenCalledWith(\n      'https://api.example.com/users/123',\n      expect.any(Object)\n    );\n  });\n});\n```\n\n#### Testing Components with User Interactions\n\n```typescript\n// SearchInput.test.tsx\nimport { describe, it, expect, vi } from 'vitest';\nimport { render, screen, fireEvent, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';\nimport { SearchInput } from './SearchInput';\n\ndescribe('SearchInput', () => {\n  it('calls onSearch after debounce delay', async () => {\n    const onSearch = vi.fn();\n    const user = userEvent.setup();\n\n    render(<SearchInput onSearch={onSearch} debounceMs={300} />);\n\n    const input = screen.getByRole('textbox');\n    await user.type(input, 'test query');\n\n    // Should not call immediately\n    expect(onSearch).not.toHaveBeenCalled();\n\n    // Wait for debounce\n    await waitFor(() => {\n      expect(onSearch).toHaveBeenCalledWith('test query');\n    }, { timeout: 500 });\n  });\n\n  it('shows clear button when input has value', async () => {\n    const user = userEvent.setup();\n    render(<SearchInput onSearch={vi.fn()} />);\n\n    const input = screen.getByRole('textbox');\n    await user.type(input, 'search term');\n\n    expect(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /clear/i })).toBeInTheDocument();\n  });\n\n  it('clears input when clear button clicked', async () => {\n    const user = userEvent.setup();\n    render(<SearchInput onSearch={vi.fn()} />);\n\n    const input = screen.getByRole('textbox') as HTMLInputElement;\n    await user.type(input, 'search term');\n\n    const clearButton = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /clear/i });\n    await user.click(clearButton);\n\n    expect(input.value).toBe('');\n  });\n});\n```\n\n### Testing Best Practices\n\n1. **Test user behavior, not implementation**\n2. **Use semantic queries** (getByRole, getByLabelText)\n3. **Wait for async operations** with waitFor\n4. **Mock external dependencies** (fetch, timers)\n5. **Test accessibility** (roles, labels, keyboard navigation)\n6. **Keep tests isolated** (clean up between tests)\n\n```typescript\n// Good practices example\ndescribe('LoginForm', () => {\n  it('shows validation error for invalid email', async () => {\n    const user = userEvent.setup();\n    render(<LoginForm onSubmit={vi.fn()} />);\n\n    const emailInput = screen.getByLabelText(/email/i);\n    const submitButton = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /login/i });\n\n    await user.type(emailInput, 'invalid-email');\n    await user.click(submitButton);\n\n    expect(await screen.findByText(/invalid email/i)).toBeInTheDocument();\n  });\n});\n```"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":4,"cache_creation_input_tokens":512,"cache_read_input_tokens":94201,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":512,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":25,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CUHeLJ51dRehkv4JyFiGw","type":"assistant","uuid":"9bb2f22c-1a70-4656-89ef-f5cdeb2dddf0","timestamp":"2025-10-20T02:16:00.946Z"}

ReactNode;\n  onError?: (error: Error, errorInfo: ErrorInfo) => void;\n}\n\ninterface State {\n  hasError: boolean;\n  error?: Error;\n}\n\nexport class ErrorBoundary extends Component<Props, State> {\n  constructor(props: Props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = { hasError: false };\n  }\n\n  static getDerivedStateFromError(error: Error): State {\n    return { hasError: true, error };\n  }\n\n  componentDidCatch(error: Error, errorInfo: ErrorInfo) {\n    console.error('Error caught by boundary:', error, errorInfo);\n    this.props.onError?.(error, errorInfo);\n  }\n\n  render() {\n

implementation**\n2. **Use semantic queries** (getByRole, getByLabelText)\n3. **Wait for async operations** with waitFor\n4. **Mock external dependencies** (fetch, timers)\n5. **Test accessibility** (roles, labels, keyboard navigation)\n6. **Keep tests isolated** (clean up between tests)\n\n```typescript\n// Good practices example\ndescribe('LoginForm', () => {\n  it('shows validation error for invalid email', async () => {\n    const user = userEvent.setup();\n    render(<LoginForm onSubmit={vi.fn()} />);\n\n    const emailInput = screen.getByLabelText(/email/i);\n    const submitButton = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /login/i });\n\n    await user.type(emailInput, 'invalid-email');\n    await user.click(submitButton);\n\n    expect(await screen.findByText(/invalid email/i)).toBeInTheDocument();\n  });\n});\n```","originalFile":"# React Modern Best Practices Reference\n\nThis document provides comprehensive guidance on modern React best practices, patterns, and anti-patterns based on the latest React documentation. All examples use TypeScript and follow Next.js App Router conventions where applicable.\n\n## Component Structure\n\n### Functional Components\nAll components should be functional components using hooks with TypeScript. Class components are legacy (except for Error Boundaries which still require classes).\n\n```typescript\n// ✅ Good: Functional component with TypeScript\ninterface UserProfileProps {\n  userId: string;\n}\n\nexport function UserProfile({ userId }: UserProfileProps) {\n  const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null);\n  return <div>{user?.name}</div>;\n}\n\n// ❌ Avoid: Class components (legacy)\nclass UserProfile extends React.Component {\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n### TypeScript Best Practices\n- Always define prop interfaces\n- Use explicit types for state\n- Avoid `any` types\n- Use generics for reusable components\n\n```typescript\n// ✅ Good: Explicit types\ninterface ButtonProps {\n  variant: 'primary' | 'secondary';\n  onClick: () => void;\n  children: ReactNode;\n  disabled?: boolean;\n}\n\nexport function Button({ variant, onClick, children, disabled = false }: ButtonProps) {\n  return (\n    <button onClick={onClick} disabled={disabled} className={variant}>\n      {children}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\n// ✅ Good: Generic components\ninterface ListProps<T> {\n  items: T[];\n  renderItem: (item: T) => ReactNode;\n  keyExtractor: (item: T) => string;\n}\n\nexport function List<T>({ items, renderItem, keyExtractor }: ListProps<T>) {\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {items.map(item => (\n        <li key={keyExtractor(item)}>{renderItem(item)}</li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Component Definition Rules\n- Define components at the module level, never inside other components\n- Avoid factory functions that create components\n- Components should be stable across renders\n\n```typescript\n// ✅ Good: Component defined at module level\ninterface ButtonProps {\n  color: string;\n  children: ReactNode;\n}\n\nexport function Button({ color, children }: ButtonProps) {\n  return <button style={{ backgroundColor: color }}>{children}</button>;\n}\n\nexport function App() {\n  return <Button color=\"red\">Click me</Button>;\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Component defined inside another component\nfunction Parent() {\n  function Child() {  // Re-created on every render!\n    return <div>Child</div>;\n  }\n  return <Child />;\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Factory function creating components\nfunction createComponent(defaultValue: string) {\n  return function Component() {\n    // ...\n  };\n}\n```\n\n## Next.js Server Components (App Router)\n\n### Server vs Client Components\n\n**Server Components (Default):**\n- Can be async functions\n- Fetch data directly with await\n- No hooks, event handlers, or browser APIs\n- Smaller bundle size\n- Better SEO and initial load\n\n**Client Components:**\n- Require 'use client' directive\n- Can use hooks and browser APIs\n- Handle interactivity and state\n\n```typescript\n// ✅ Server Component (default)\ninterface Post {\n  id: string;\n  title: string;\n  content: string;\n}\n\ninterface BlogPostProps {\n  postId: string;\n}\n\nexport async function BlogPost({ postId }: BlogPostProps) {\n  // Direct data fetching in Server Component\n  const post: Post = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/posts/${postId}`, {\n    next: { revalidate: 3600 } // ISR: revalidate every hour\n  }).then(res => res.json());\n\n  return (\n    <article>\n      <h1>{post.title}</h1>\n      <p>{post.content}</p>\n    </article>\n  );\n}\n\n// ✅ Client Component (when needed)\n'use client';\n\ninterface LikeButtonProps {\n  postId: string;\n  initialLikes: number;\n}\n\nexport function LikeButton({ postId, initialLikes }: LikeButtonProps) {\n  const [likes, setLikes] = useState(initialLikes);\n  const [isLiked, setIsLiked] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleLike = async () => {\n    setIsLiked(!isLiked);\n    setLikes(isLiked ? likes - 1 : likes + 1);\n    await fetch(`/api/posts/${postId}/like`, { method: 'POST' });\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <button onClick={handleLike}>\n      {isLiked ? '❤️' : '🤍'} {likes}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Composing Server and Client Components\n\n```typescript\n// app/posts/[id]/page.tsx (Server Component)\nimport { LikeButton } from '@/components/LikeButton';\nimport { Comments } from '@/components/Comments';\n\nexport default async function PostPage({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {\n  const [post, comments] = await Promise.all([\n    fetch(`https://api.example.com/posts/${params.id}`).then(res => res.json()),\n    fetch(`https://api.example.com/posts/${params.id}/comments`).then(res => res.json())\n  ]);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>{post.title}</h1>\n      <p>{post.content}</p>\n\n      {/* Client Component for interactivity */}\n      <LikeButton postId={post.id} initialLikes={post.likes} />\n\n      {/* Can pass server-fetched data to client components */}\n      <Comments comments={comments} postId={post.id} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## React 19 Features\n\n### The `use` Hook\n\nThe `use` hook unwraps promises and context values. Unlike other hooks, it can be called conditionally.\n\n```typescript\n'use client';\n\nimport { use, Suspense } from 'react';\n\ninterface User {\n  id: string;\n  name: string;\n  email: string;\n}\n\n// ✅ Using the use hook with promises\nfunction UserProfile({ userPromise }: { userPromise: Promise<User> }) {\n  const user = use(userPromise); // Unwraps the promise\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>{user.name}</h2>\n      <p>{user.email}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\n// Wrap with Suspense\nexport function UserProfilePage({ userId }: { userId: string }) {\n  const userPromise = fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`).then(res => res.json());\n\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading user...</div>}>\n      <UserProfile userPromise={userPromise} />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n\n// ✅ Conditional use of the use hook (unique to this hook!)\nfunction Message({ messagePromise, showMessage }: {\n  messagePromise: Promise<string>;\n  showMessage: boolean;\n}) {\n  if (!showMessage) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  const message = use(messagePromise); // Can be conditional!\n  return <p>{message}</p>;\n}\n```\n\n### Error Handling with use Hook\n\n```typescript\n'use client';\n\nimport { use, Suspense } from 'react';\n\nfunction DataDisplay({ dataPromise }: { dataPromise: Promise<Data> }) {\n  const data = use(dataPromise); // Errors bubble to nearest ErrorBoundary\n  return <div>{data.value}</div>;\n}\n\nexport function DataPage() {\n  const dataPromise = fetchData();\n\n  return (\n    <ErrorBoundary fallback={<ErrorUI />}>\n      <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n        <DataDisplay dataPromise={dataPromise} />\n      </Suspense>\n    </ErrorBoundary>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Hooks Best Practices\n\n### Rules of Hooks\n1. Only call hooks at the top level of function components or custom hooks\n2. Never call hooks conditionally, in loops, or after early returns\n3. Hook calls must be in the same order on every render\n\n```typescript\n// ✅ Good: Hooks at top level\ninterface ComponentProps {\n  isSpecial: boolean;\n}\n\nfunction Component({ isSpecial }: ComponentProps) {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  const [name, setName] = useState('');\n\n  if (!isSpecial) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  return <div>{name}: {count}</div>;\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Conditional hook\nfunction Component({ isLoggedIn }: { isLoggedIn: boolean }) {\n  if (isLoggedIn) {\n    const [user, setUser] = useState<User | null>(null); // Violates Rules of Hooks!\n  }\n  return <div>...</div>;\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Hook after early return\nfunction Component({ data }: { data: string | null }) {\n  if (!data) return <Loading />;\n  const [processed, setProcessed] = useState(data); // Never called when data is null!\n  return <div>{processed}</div>;\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Hook in callback\nfunction Component() {\n  return (\n    <button onClick={() => {\n      const [clicked, setClicked] = useState(false); // Hooks can't be in event handlers!\n    }}>\n      Click\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### useState Hook\n- Use for local component state\n- State setter functions can accept updater functions for atomic updates\n- Multiple useState calls are better than complex state objects for unrelated data\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Separate state for independent values\nfunction Form() {\n  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('');\n  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('');\n  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');\n  // ...\n}\n\n// ✅ Good: Updater function for state based on previous state\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n\n  const increment = () => {\n    setCount(c => c + 1); // Uses previous value\n  };\n\n  return <button onClick={increment}>{count}</button>;\n}\n```\n\n### useEffect Hook\n- Use for synchronization with external systems (APIs, subscriptions, DOM)\n- Always return cleanup functions when needed\n- Specify all dependencies in the dependency array\n- Separate unrelated effects into different useEffect calls\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Separate effects for separate concerns\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    logVisit(roomId);\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  }, [roomId]);\n\n  // ...\n}\n\n// ✅ Good: Cleanup function for subscriptions\nuseEffect(() => {\n  const subscription = subscribe(callback);\n  return () => subscription.unsubscribe();\n}, [callback]);\n\n// ❌ Avoid: Multiple concerns in one effect\nuseEffect(() => {\n  logVisit(roomId);\n  const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);\n  connection.connect();\n  return () => connection.disconnect();\n}, [roomId]); // Mixes analytics and connection logic\n```\n\n### useContext Hook\n- Use for accessing context values\n- Wrap context access in custom hooks for better ergonomics\n- Context providers should be at appropriate levels in the tree\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Custom hooks for context access\nexport function useTasks() {\n  return useContext(TasksContext);\n}\n\nexport function useTasksDispatch() {\n  return useContext(TasksDispatchContext);\n}\n\n// Usage in components\nfunction TaskList() {\n  const tasks = useTasks();\n  const dispatch = useTasksDispatch();\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n### useCallback Hook\n- Use to memoize callback functions\n- Essential when passing callbacks to optimized child components\n- Custom hooks should wrap returned functions in useCallback\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Memoize callbacks in custom hooks\nfunction useRouter() {\n  const { dispatch } = useContext(RouterStateContext);\n\n  const navigate = useCallback((url) => {\n    dispatch({ type: 'navigate', url });\n  }, [dispatch]);\n\n  const goBack = useCallback(() => {\n    dispatch({ type: 'back' });\n  }, [dispatch]);\n\n  return { navigate, goBack };\n}\n```\n\n### useMemo Hook\n- Use to memoize expensive computations\n- Helps optimize performance when combined with immutable arguments\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Memoize expensive computations\nfunction useIconStyle(icon) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n\n  return useMemo(() => {\n    const newIcon = { ...icon };\n    if (newIcon.enabled) {\n      newIcon.className = computeStyle(newIcon, theme);\n    }\n    return newIcon;\n  }, [icon, theme]);\n}\n```\n\n## Custom Hooks\n\n### Purpose and Naming\n- Extract reusable stateful logic into custom hooks\n- Always prefix custom hooks with \"use\"\n- Custom hooks enable logic sharing without component hierarchy changes\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Custom hook for form input logic\nfunction useFormInput(initialValue) {\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);\n\n  const handleChange = (e) => {\n    setValue(e.target.value);\n  };\n\n  return {\n    value,\n    onChange: handleChange\n  };\n}\n\n// Usage\nfunction Form() {\n  const firstNameProps = useFormInput('Mary');\n  const lastNameProps = useFormInput('Poppins');\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <input {...firstNameProps} />\n      <input {...lastNameProps} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Custom Hook Best Practices\n- Never pass hooks as props or create higher-order hooks\n- Don't mutate hook arguments\n- Avoid custom \"lifecycle\" hooks that just wrap useEffect\n- Return stable function references with useCallback\n\n```javascript\n// ❌ Bad: Don't pass hooks as props\nfunction ChatInput() {\n  return <Button useData={useDataWithLogging} />\n}\n\n// ✅ Good: Call hooks directly where needed\nfunction ChatInput() {\n  return <Button />\n}\n\nfunction Button() {\n  const data = useDataWithLogging();\n  // ...\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Custom lifecycle hooks\nfunction useMount(fn) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    fn();\n  }, []); // Missing dependency: fn\n}\n\n// ✅ Good: Use useEffect directly with proper dependencies\nfunction ChatRoom({ roomId }) {\n  useEffect(() => {\n    const connection = createConnection(roomId);\n    connection.connect();\n    return () => connection.disconnect();\n  }, [roomId]);\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Don't mutate hook arguments\nfunction useIconStyle(icon) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  if (icon.enabled) {\n    icon.className = computeStyle(icon, theme); // Mutation!\n  }\n  return icon;\n}\n\n// ✅ Good: Create new objects instead\nfunction useIconStyle(icon) {\n  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);\n  const newIcon = { ...icon };\n  if (newIcon.enabled) {\n    newIcon.className = computeStyle(newIcon, theme);\n  }\n  return newIcon;\n}\n```\n\n### Common Custom Hook Patterns\n\n#### Data Fetching Hook\n```javascript\nfunction useData(url) {\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    if (!url) return;\n\n    let ignore = false;\n    fetch(url)\n      .then(response => response.json())\n      .then(json => {\n        if (!ignore) {\n          setData(json);\n        }\n      });\n\n    return () => {\n      ignore = true;\n    };\n  }, [url]);\n\n  return data;\n}\n\n// Usage\nfunction ShippingForm({ country }) {\n  const cities = useData(`/api/cities?country=${country}`);\n  const [city, setCity] = useState(null);\n  const areas = useData(city ? `/api/areas?city=${city}` : null);\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n#### External Store Subscription Hook\n```javascript\nfunction useOnlineStatus() {\n  const isOnline = useSyncExternalStore(subscribe, getSnapshot);\n  return isOnline;\n}\n\nfunction getSnapshot() {\n  return navigator.onLine;\n}\n\nfunction subscribe(callback) {\n  window.addEventListener('online', callback);\n  window.addEventListener('offline', callback);\n  return () => {\n    window.removeEventListener('online', callback);\n    window.removeEventListener('offline', callback);\n  };\n}\n```\n\n## Component Patterns\n\n### Composition Over Hierarchy\n- Pass JSX as children for flexibility\n- Use render props when children need access to internal state\n- Avoid deeply nested prop drilling\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Composition with children\nfunction Card({ children, title }) {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"card\">\n      <h2>{title}</h2>\n      {children}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Card title=\"User Profile\">\n      <UserAvatar />\n      <UserDetails />\n    </Card>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### Event Handlers\n- Define event handlers inside the component\n- Use arrow functions for handlers that need parameters\n- Avoid creating new function references unnecessarily in render\n\n```javascript\nfunction Button() {\n  const handleClick = () => {\n    console.log('clicked');\n  };\n\n  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;\n}\n\n// With parameters\nfunction ItemList({ items }) {\n  const handleItemClick = (id) => {\n    console.log('Item clicked:', id);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {items.map(item => (\n        <li key={item.id} onClick={() => handleItemClick(item.id)}>\n          {item.name}\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Purity and Immutability\n\n### Component Purity\n- Components should be pure functions of their props\n- Never mutate props or state directly\n- Avoid side effects in the render phase\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Pure component\nfunction UserGreeting({ user }) {\n  return <h1>Hello, {user.name}!</h1>;\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Mutating props\nfunction UserGreeting({ user }) {\n  user.lastSeen = new Date(); // Never mutate props!\n  return <h1>Hello, {user.name}!</h1>;\n}\n```\n\n### Immutability in State Updates\n- Always create new objects/arrays for state updates\n- Use spread operators for shallow copies\n- Use array methods that return new arrays (map, filter, etc.)\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Immutable state updates\nfunction TodoList() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    setTodos([...todos, { id: Date.now(), text }]);\n  };\n\n  const removeTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.filter(todo => todo.id !== id));\n  };\n\n  const toggleTodo = (id) => {\n    setTodos(todos.map(todo =>\n      todo.id === id ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed } : todo\n    ));\n  };\n\n  // ...\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Mutating state\nfunction TodoList() {\n  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);\n\n  const addTodo = (text) => {\n    todos.push({ id: Date.now(), text }); // Mutation!\n    setTodos(todos); // Won't trigger re-render correctly\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### JSX and Props Immutability\n- Never mutate values after passing to JSX\n- Create new objects for different props\n\n```javascript\n// ✅ Good: Create new objects for different props\nfunction Page({ colour }) {\n  const headerStyles = { colour, size: \"large\" };\n  const header = <Header styles={headerStyles} />;\n  const footerStyles = { colour, size: \"small\" };\n  const footer = <Footer styles={footerStyles} />;\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      {header}\n      <Content />\n      {footer}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\n// ❌ Bad: Mutating after passing to JSX\nfunction Page({ colour }) {\n  const styles = { colour, size: \"large\" };\n  const header = <Header styles={styles} />;\n  styles.size = \"small\"; // Mutation after use in JSX!\n  const footer = <Footer styles={styles} />;\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      {header}\n      <Content />\n      {footer}\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\n### When to Optimize\n- Measure before optimizing\n- Use React DevTools Profiler\n- Focus on slow renders and unnecessary re-renders\n\n### Optimization Techniques\n1. **React.memo** - Memoize components to prevent re-renders\n2. **useMemo** - Memoize expensive computations\n3. **useCallback** - Memoize callback functions\n4. **Code splitting** - Lazy load components\n5. **Virtualization** - Render only visible items in long lists\n\n```javascript\n// Memoized component\nconst MemoizedComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent({ data }) {\n  return <div>{data}</div>;\n});\n\n// With custom comparison\nconst MemoizedComponent = React.memo(\n  function MyComponent({ data }) {\n    return <div>{data}</div>;\n  },\n  (prevProps, nextProps) => {\n    return prevProps.data.id === nextProps.data.id;\n  }\n);\n```\n\n## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n1. **Don't use indexes as keys in lists** (unless list is static and items don't have unique IDs)\n2. **Don't call hooks conditionally**\n3. **Don't mutate state or props**\n4. **Don't create components inside components**\n5. **Don't pass hooks as props**\n6. **Avoid deeply nested prop drilling** (use context instead)\n7. **Don't use useEffect for derived state** (calculate during render instead)\n8. **Avoid unnecessary state** (derive from props when possible)\n\n## Modern React Features\n\n### Concurrent Features\n- React 18+ supports concurrent rendering\n- Use `useTransition` for non-urgent updates\n- Use `useDeferredValue` for deferring expensive renders\n\n### Server Components (Next.js, etc.)\n- Server Components fetch data on the server\n- Reduce client-side JavaScript bundle size\n- Better initial page load performance\n\n### Suspense\n- Handle loading states declaratively\n- Works with lazy loading and data fetching\n- Enables better user experiences during async operations\n\n```javascript\n// Lazy loading with Suspense\nconst LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>\n      <LazyComponent />\n    </Suspense>\n  );\n}\n```\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":820,"oldLines":11,"newStart":820,"newLines":11,"lines":[" - Works with lazy loading and data fetching"," - Enables better user experiences during async operations"," ","-```javascript","+```typescript"," // Lazy loading with Suspense"," const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));"," ","-function App() {","+export function App() {","   return (","     <Suspense fallback={<Loading />}>","       <LazyComponent />"]},{"oldStart":832,"oldLines":3,"newStart":832,"newLines":397,"lines":["   );"," }"," ```","+","+## Error Handling","+","+### Error Boundaries","+","+Error boundaries catch JavaScript errors in child components and display fallback UI.
